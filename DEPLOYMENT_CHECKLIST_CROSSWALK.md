## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Run crosswalk table creation
# File: supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_create_cip_soc_crosswalk.sql
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cip_soc_crosswalk;
-- Should return 66 rows (current crosswalk entries)

-- Check job coverage
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT soc_code) FROM cip_soc_crosswalk;
-- Should return 40 (all jobs covered)
```

### 2. Populate Crosswalk (if needed)
```bash
# Add any missing entries
node scripts/fix-missing-crosswalk-entries.js

# Expected output: "100% COVERAGE ACHIEVED!"
```

### 3. Verify System Health
```bash
# Run comprehensive audit
node scripts/audit-crosswalk-coverage.js

# Expected metrics:
# - Jobs ‚Üí SOC codes: 100%
# - Jobs ‚Üí Crosswalk: 100%
# - Jobs ‚Üí Programs: 82%
# - Programs Valid: 100%
```

### 4. Code Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build

# Or deploy via CI/CD pipeline
# Vercel/Netlify will auto-deploy on push to main
```

### 5. Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. ‚úÖ

## üß™ Manual QA Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Job Details Page
1. [ ] Navigate to `/jobs/[any-job-id]`
2. [ ] Scroll to "Relevant Education & Training Programs"
3. [ ] Verify programs display (or empty state if none)
4. [ ] Check program quality (no "Skills:" or "Build:" names)
5. [ ] Verify SimpleProgramCard design
6. [ ] Click "Load More" if available
7. [ ] Verify programs are relevant to job

### Test Scenario 2: Assessment Results (Role-Ready)
1. [ ] Complete assessment with high score (‚â• threshold)
2. [ ] View results page
3. [ ] Verify skeleton loading appears first
4. [ ] Verify toast notification appears once
5. [ ] Check toast message: "Assessment Results Shared with [Company]"
6. [ ] Verify programs display
7. [ ] Check console for: "‚úÖ Added to [Company]'s invite queue"
8. [ ] Refresh page - toast should NOT appear again

### Test Scenario 3: Assessment Results (Has Gaps)
1. [ ] Complete assessment with some low scores
2. [ ] View results page
3. [ ] Verify toast notification appears
4. [ ] Verify programs display (gap-filling)
5. [ ] Programs should address specific gap skills
6. [ ] Check console for gap skills addressed

### Test Scenario 4: Auto-Invite System
1. [ ] Complete assessment with qualifying score
2. [ ] Check `invitations` table in database
3. [ ] Verify new record exists:
   - [ ] Correct user_id
   - [ ] Correct job_id
   - [ ] Correct company_id
   - [ ] status = 'pending'
   - [ ] source = 'auto_qualified'
   - [ ] readiness_score = actual percentage
4. [ ] Complete same assessment again
5. [ ] Verify NO duplicate invitation created

### Test Scenario 5: Quality Filtering
1. [ ] Navigate to any job with programs
2. [ ] Verify NO programs with:
   - [ ] Names starting with "Skills:"
   - [ ] Names starting with "Build:"
   - [ ] Missing descriptions
3. [ ] All programs should be complete and valid

### Test Scenario 6: System Monitoring
1. [ ] Run audit script: `node scripts/audit-crosswalk-coverage.js`
2. [ ] Verify 100% job coverage
3. [ ] Check for any HIGH severity issues
4. [ ] Review MEDIUM severity issues (acceptable)
5. [ ] Verify all programs have valid data

## üîç Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
- [ ] Crosswalk lookup performance (<50ms)
- [ ] Program fetch performance (<100ms)
- [ ] Auto-invite creation rate
- [ ] Toast notification display rate
- [ ] Empty state frequency (jobs without programs)

### Database Queries to Monitor
```sql
-- Jobs without programs
SELECT j.title, j.soc_code
FROM jobs j
LEFT JOIN cip_soc_crosswalk c ON c.soc_code = j.soc_code
LEFT JOIN programs p ON p.cip_code = c.cip_code AND p.status = 'published'
WHERE j.status = 'published'
GROUP BY j.id, j.title, j.soc_code
HAVING COUNT(p.id) = 0;

-- Auto-invite success rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE source = 'auto_qualified') as auto_invites,
  COUNT(*) as total_invites,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE source = 'auto_qualified') * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as auto_percentage
FROM invitations;

-- Program view frequency
SELECT p.name, COUNT(DISTINCT j.id) as job_count
FROM programs p
JOIN cip_soc_crosswalk c ON c.cip_code = p.cip_code
JOIN jobs j ON j.soc_code = c.soc_code
WHERE p.status = 'published'
GROUP BY p.id, p.name
ORDER BY job_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### By Design (Acceptable)
- **7 jobs without programs** - Need education partners to add programs
- **Empty states shown** - Graceful handling when no programs exist
- **Toast shows once** - Prevents spam on page refresh
- **Skill-based vs crosswalk** - Different logic by design

### None Critical
All core functionality is working and tested. ‚úÖ

---

## üÜò Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

### 1. Revert Code
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
git push
```

### 2. Revert Database (if needed)
```sql
-- Drop crosswalk table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cip_soc_crosswalk;

-- System will fall back to skill-based matching only
```

### 3. Clear Cache
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```
