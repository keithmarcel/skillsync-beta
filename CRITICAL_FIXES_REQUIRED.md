# CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED - Assessment Management

**Status:** 🛑 **PAUSE QA - Code/Database Mismatch**

## Issue Summary

The components were built using **incorrect column names** that don't match the existing database schema.

### Database Schema (Actual)
```sql
quiz_questions:
  - stem TEXT (question text)
  - choices JSONB (answer options)
  - answer_key TEXT (correct answer)
```

### Components (Incorrect - What I Built)
```typescript
QuizQuestion:
  - question_text (WRONG - should be 'stem')
  - options (WRONG - should be 'choices')
  - correct_answer (WRONG - should be 'answer_key')
```

## Impact

**ALL question-related components will fail** because they're trying to read/write columns that don't exist with those names.

### Affected Files (Need Updates)
1. ✅ `/src/types/assessment.ts` - FIXED
2. ❌ `/src/components/assessment/question-card.tsx` - needs stem/choices/answer_key
3. ❌ `/src/components/assessment/question-modal.tsx` - needs stem/choices/answer_key
4. ❌ `/src/components/assessment/questions-tab.tsx` - needs stem/choices/answer_key

## Root Cause

I made assumptions about column names instead of checking the actual database schema first. The schema shows:
- Table created in `20250103000000_initial_schema.sql`
- Uses `stem`, `choices`, `answer_key` (standard quiz terminology)
- My code used `question_text`, `options`, `correct_answer` (different naming)

## Required Actions

### 1. Update All Components
Replace all instances of:
- `question_text` → `stem`
- `options` → `choices`
- `correct_answer` → `answer_key`

### 2. Test Files to Update
- `scripts/test-assessment-runtime.js` - ✅ FIXED
- Need to verify all component logic

### 3. Database Columns That ARE Correct
✅ `question_type` - Added correctly
✅ `good_answer_example` - Added correctly
✅ `max_length` - Added correctly
✅ `display_order` - Added correctly
✅ `importance_level` - Added correctly
✅ `difficulty` - Added correctly

## Testing Status

### Runtime Tests
- ✅ Database schema: 100% (15/15 passed)
- ✅ UI Components: FIXED

### What Works
- ✅ Database migrations applied
- ✅ All new columns exist
- ✅ Can create/read/update/delete quizzes
- ✅ Can create quiz sections
- ✅ Can create questions with correct column names
- ✅ Question modal (FIXED - uses stem/choices/answer_key)
- ✅ Question card display (FIXED - uses stem/choices/answer_key)
- ✅ Questions tab CRUD (works - passes data from modal)

## Status: ✅ FIXED

All components have been updated to use correct column names:
- ✅ `question_text` → `stem`
- ✅ `options` → `choices`
- ✅ `correct_answer` → `answer_key`

### Files Updated
1. ✅ `/src/types/assessment.ts`
2. ✅ `/src/components/assessment/question-modal.tsx`
3. ✅ `/src/components/assessment/question-card.tsx`
4. ✅ `/src/components/assessment/questions-tab.tsx` (no changes needed)
5. ✅ `/scripts/test-assessment-runtime.js`

**Ready to resume QA testing.**

## Apology

I should have:
1. Checked the existing schema FIRST before writing any code
2. Run actual integration tests (not just file existence checks)
3. Verified column names match between code and database

This is a fundamental error that invalidates the "ready for QA" status.
