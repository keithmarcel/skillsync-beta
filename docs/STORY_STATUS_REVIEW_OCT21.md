## ‚úÖ ASSESS-301: "What to Expect" and Timeline Block

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (100%)

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// File: src/app/(main)/assessments/[id]/intro/page.tsx (Line 139-142)
{/* What to Expect */}
<div className="space-y-4 mb-8">
  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What to Expect:</h3>
  <div className="space-y-3">
    <div className="flex items-start gap-3">
      <CheckCircle2 className="h-6 w-6 text-teal-600 flex-shrink-0 mt-0.5" />
```

```typescript
// File: src/app/(main)/assessments/quiz/[quizId]/page.tsx (Line 365-368)
<CardTitle className="text-xl font-bold font-source-sans-pro">What to Expect</CardTitle>
<CardDescription className="text-base">

</CardDescription>
```

// File: src/app/(main)/assessments/[id]/intro/page.tsx (Line 136)
<span className="font-medium">This assessment takes ~5 minutes</span>
```

**Location:** Pre-assessment intro page and quiz page sidebar

**Status in Roadmap:** Marked as incomplete but actually exists

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Mark as complete in roadmap

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ASSESS-301: Eliminate Resume Upload (use LinkedIn URL only)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Exists but Not Used (50%)

**Current State:**
- Resume upload page exists at `/assessments/resume/[jobId]/page.tsx`
- Full implementation with file upload, validation, progress tracking
- **BUT:** Not linked in main assessment flow
- Users go directly to quiz, not resume upload

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// File: src/app/(main)/assessments/resume/[jobId]/page.tsx
// Full resume upload implementation with:
- File validation (PDF, DOC, DOCX, 5MB limit)
- Upload progress simulation
- LLM processing simulation
- Error handling
```

**Assessment Flow:**
1. Job details page ‚Üí "Take Assessment" button
2. Goes to `/assessments/[id]/intro` (intro page)
3. Then to `/assessments/quiz/[quizId]` (quiz)
4. Resume upload page is orphaned

**What's Needed:**
1. **Option A:** Remove resume upload entirely (if LinkedIn-only)
2. **Option B:** Add resume upload as alternative path before quiz
3. **Option C:** Replace resume with LinkedIn URL input

**Recommendation:** 
Clarify requirement - should resume upload be:
- Removed completely?
- Replaced with LinkedIn URL?
- Kept as alternative to quiz?

## ‚úÖ ASSESS-321: Auto-Share After Consent Enabled

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (100%)

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// File: src/lib/services/auto-invite.ts (Line 117-120)
/**
 * Main function: Process assessment completion and auto-invite if qualified
 */
export async function processAssessmentCompletion(
  assessmentId: string
```

```typescript
// File: src/app/api/assessments/analyze/route.ts (Line 232-235)
const visibilityThreshold = assessment.job?.visibility_threshold_pct || 85;

if (readinessPct >= visibilityThreshold) {
  console.log(`üéØ Proficiency ${readinessPct}% meets threshold ${visibilityThreshold}% - creating auto-invite...`);
```

**Implementation:**
- Auto-invite service checks user consent via `checkUserConsent()`
- Creates employer invitation when proficiency ‚â• visibility threshold
- Respects user's `agreed_to_terms` (implicit consent)
- Called from assessment results page after analysis

**Verified:** October 21, 2025 - Working end-to-end

**Status in Roadmap:** Marked as incomplete but fully working

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Mark as complete in roadmap

## ‚úÖ ASSESS-320: Consent-Aware Prompt on Assessment Completion

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (100%) - **UPDATED October 21, 2025 8:41 PM**

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// File: src/components/settings/consent-toggle-dialog.tsx
export function ConsentToggleDialog({
  open,
  onOpenChange,
  action,
  invitationCount = 0,
  onConfirm
}: ConsentToggleDialogProps)
```

```typescript
// File: src/components/settings/profile-tab.tsx (Line 67-75)
// Handle consent toggle with confirmation dialog
const handleConsentToggle = async (checked: boolean) => {
  const currentValue = formData.visible_to_employers
  
  // If toggling, show confirmation dialog
  if (checked !== currentValue) {
    setPendingConsentValue(checked)
    setShowConsentDialog(true)
  }
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Consent toggle in user settings (Profile tab)
- Confirmation dialog when enabling/disabling
- Shows count of invitations that will be affected
- Withdraws invitations when consent revoked
- Backfills invitations when consent granted

**Services:**
- `withdrawAllInvitations()` - Sets invitations to 'withdrawn' status
- `backfillQualifyingInvitations()` - Creates invitations for past assessments
- `getActiveInvitationsCount()` - Shows impact before toggle

**Database Migration:**
- `20251021000002_add_withdrawn_status.sql` - Adds 'withdrawn' status

**Status in Roadmap:** Marked as incomplete but fully implemented

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Mark as complete in roadmap

**UPDATE (Oct 21, 8:41 PM):** Added dynamic consent prompt on assessment results page
- Shows different message based on `visible_to_employers` status
- WITH consent: "Your readiness score has been shared with [Company]"
- WITHOUT consent: "Share your results to receive employer invitations"
- Includes "Enable Sharing ‚Üí" button linking to settings when no consent
- Only shows for role-ready users without consent

## ‚úÖ ASSESS-310: Retake Cooldown (24-hour limit)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (100%)

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// File: src/app/(main)/my-assessments/page.tsx (Line 250-256)
// Cooldown logic
const analyzedAt = new Date(assessment.analyzed_at || assessment.created_at)
const now = new Date()
const hoursSinceAnalysis = (now.getTime() - analyzedAt.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60)
const hoursRemaining = Math.max(0, 24 - hoursSinceAnalysis)
const isOnCooldown = hoursRemaining > 0
const isRoleReady = assessment.status_tag === 'role_ready'
```

```typescript
// File: src/app/(main)/my-assessments/page.tsx (Line 308-320)
) : isOnCooldown ? (
  <Tooltip>
    <TooltipTrigger asChild>
      <span className="flex-1">
        <Button variant="outline" size="sm" className="w-full" disabled>
          Retake in {Math.ceil(hoursRemaining)}h
        </Button>
      </span>
    </TooltipTrigger>
    <TooltipContent className="max-w-[200px]">
      <p>Assessments can only be taken once every 24 hours. Come back in {Math.ceil(hoursRemaining)} hours.</p>
    </TooltipContent>
  </Tooltip>
```

**Implementation:**
- Calculates time since last assessment completion
- Disables "Retake" button during cooldown
- Shows countdown timer ("Retake in Xh")
- Tooltip explains cooldown policy
- Role-ready users see "View Invites" instead

**Completed:** October 21, 2025 as part of My Assessments Phase 3K

**Status in Roadmap:** Marked as incomplete but fully implemented

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Mark as complete in roadmap

## ‚ö†Ô∏è EMPLOYER-603: Set Invite Threshold (Auto-Invite Score)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Complete, UI Placeholder (75%)

**Backend Evidence:**
```typescript
// File: src/app/api/assessments/analyze/route.ts (Line 232)
const visibilityThreshold = assessment.job?.visibility_threshold_pct || 85;
```

```typescript
// File: src/app/(main)/employer/roles/[id]/page.tsx (Line 17-18)
interface Job {
  required_proficiency_pct: number
  visibility_threshold_pct: number
```

**Database:**
- ‚úÖ `jobs.visibility_threshold_pct` column exists
- ‚úÖ Auto-invite system reads this field
- ‚úÖ Creates invitation when `readiness_pct >= visibility_threshold_pct`

**UI Status:**
```typescript
// File: src/app/(main)/employer/roles/[id]/page.tsx (Line 107-135)
{/* Edit/Manage Form Placeholder */}
<div className="bg-white rounded-lg border border-gray-200 p-12">
  <div className="text-center">
    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">
      Edit/ Manage Individual Featured Role
    </h3>
    <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Place all edit options a company can use to edit and manage a selected role
    </p>
    <ul className="text-sm text-gray-500 space-y-1 text-left max-w-md mx-auto">
      <li>‚Ä¢ required proficiency</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ proficiency threshold for invites (ex. show ‚â•84% in invites list)</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Job Application URL</li>
      ...
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
```

**What's Complete:**
- ‚úÖ Database field exists
- ‚úÖ Backend reads and uses the field
- ‚úÖ Auto-invite system working
- ‚úÖ Field is in Job interface

**What's Missing:**
- ‚ùå Actual form UI to edit the field
- ‚ùå Input validation
- ‚ùå Save functionality
- ‚ùå Current value display

**What's Needed:**
1. Replace placeholder with actual form
2. Add number input for `visibility_threshold_pct` (0-100)
3. Add save handler to update database
4. Show current value
5. Add validation (must be ‚â§ required_proficiency_pct)

**Status in Roadmap:** Marked "VERIFY COMPLETE" but UI is placeholder

**Recommendation:** 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mark as "Backend Complete, UI Pending"
- Create new story: **EMPLOYER-603-UI**: Build Role Editor Form
