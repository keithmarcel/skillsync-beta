# Session Summary - October 1, 2025

## 🎯 Major Accomplishments

### **1. Three-Layer Weighting System** ✅
- **Question-level importance** (1.0-5.0 scale)
- **Skill-level importance** (critical/important/helpful)
- **Market demand multipliers** (from Lightcast data)
- **Result:** Accurate role readiness scores (60-79% target range)

### **2. O*NET Skills Pipeline** ✅
- **100% coverage:** 30/30 standard occupations populated
- **9-14 skills per occupation** (broad, universal, assessable)
- **Parent SOC fallback** for edge cases
- **Filtered generic abilities** (Near Vision, English Language, etc.)
- **Source:** Government-validated O*NET API

### **3. Two-Track Skills Mapping** ✅
- **Track 1:** Standard occupations → O*NET only (universal skills)
- **Track 2:** Featured roles → Hybrid (Lightcast + AI + job description)
- **Track 3:** Programs → CIP → SOC → Skills inheritance
- **Result:** Appropriate skills for each use case

### **4. Question Bank System** ✅
- **Phase 1:** Generate 10-15 questions per skill (100-150 per occupation)
- **Phase 2:** Dynamic assembly (select top 5-7 skills, 20-25 questions)
- **Anti-cheating:** Different questions each time
- **Database schema:** is_bank_question, user_question_history
- **Status:** Automated generation running (3,600+ questions)

### **5. Quiz Generation Fixes** ✅
- **Answer key randomization** (A, B, C, D cycling)
- **Question repetition prevention** (AI prompt improvements)
- **Individual contributor focus** (not manager scenarios)
- **Result:** Higher quality, more diverse questions

### **6. Program-Skills-Assessment Integration** ✅
- **Program enrichment:** CIP → SOC → Skills + AI course analysis
- **Gap matching:** Weighted algorithm (60%+ threshold)
- **Importance weighting:** 3x critical, 2x important, 1x helpful
- **Gap size weighting:** Larger gaps prioritized
- **Complete architecture documented**

## 🧪 Testing Status

### **Question Bank System:**
- ✅ 7/7 tests passing
- ✅ Schema validation
- ✅ Skill selection logic
- ✅ Assessment size validation
- ⏳ Random sampling (needs question data)
- ⏳ Anti-repeat (needs question data)

### **Program Matching:**
- ✅ Test framework created
- ⏳ Needs assessment data to run
- ⏳ Needs program enrichment to run

---

## 📋 Next Steps

### **Immediate (Today/Tomorrow):**
1. ⏳ Wait for question bank generation to complete
2. ⏳ Run program enrichment for existing programs
3. ⏳ Generate test assessment with new questions
4. ⏳ Run Phase 1 tests (gap matching validation)
5. ⏳ Validate 60% threshold produces quality matches

### **Phase 2 (UI Integration):**
1. 📋 Extract program card component from `/programs` page
2. 📋 Integrate program recommendations into assessment results page
3. 📋 TODO: UI overhaul to match mockup (assessment results)
4. 📋 Add skill gap visualization
5. 📋 (Optional) Learning path component

### **Phase 3 (Optimization):**
1. 📋 Add caching for program matches
2. 📋 Implement A/B testing for thresholds
3. 📋 Analytics dashboard for conversion tracking
4. 📋 Performance optimization

## 💡 Key Innovations

### **1. Intelligent Skill Selection**
Instead of testing ALL skills (150+ questions), we:
- Select top 5-7 critical/important skills only
- Generate 10-15 questions per skill
- Randomly sample 3-4 questions per skill
- Result: 20-25 question assessments that are still accurate

### **2. Weighted Match Scoring**
```typescript
match_score = Σ(importance_weight × gap_weight × coverage) / total_weight

Where:
- importance_weight = critical ? 3 : important ? 2 : 1
- gap_weight = 1 + (gap_size / 100)
- coverage = program teaches this skill ? 1 : 0
```

### **3. Two-Track Skills Approach**
- **Standard occupations:** Broad, universal skills (O*NET)
- **Featured roles:** Specific, vendor-focused skills (Lightcast + AI)
- **Programs:** Inherited from SOC + course analysis

### **4. Anti-Cheating System**
- Large question banks (100-150 per occupation)
- Random sampling each time
- Track user history (don't repeat within 30 days)
- Different questions = can't memorize answers
