## 📋 PENDING

### 1. Complete Question Bank Generation
- **Remaining:** 29/30 occupations
- **Action:** Let script complete (monitor log)
- **Validation:** Run `node scripts/test-question-bank.js`

### 2. Program Enrichment
- **Current:** 113/222 programs (51%)
- **Remaining:** 109 programs
- **Action:** Run after question bank completes
- **Script:** Create batch enrichment runner

### 3. Generate Test Assessment
- **Blocker:** Need question bank complete
- **Action:** Use admin UI to generate assessment
- **Purpose:** Test dynamic assembly + weighted scoring

### 4. Validate Gap Matching
- **Blocker:** Need test assessment
- **Action:** Run `node scripts/test-program-matching.js`
- **Purpose:** Verify 60% threshold and recommendations

### 5. UI Integration
- **Extract program card component** from `/programs`
- **Add to assessment results page**
- **Wire up recommendations API**

## 🐛 ISSUES FIXED TODAY

### 1. O*NET API Endpoints
- **Issue:** Used wrong endpoints (/knowledge vs /summary/knowledge)
- **Fix:** Updated to use /summary/ endpoints
- **Result:** All 30 occupations populated successfully

### 2. Answer Key Randomization
- **Issue:** All answers were "B" (AI bias)
- **Fix:** Force cycle through A, B, C, D after generation
- **Result:** Proper distribution of answer keys

### 3. Question Repetition
- **Issue:** Similar questions, manager-focused scenarios
- **Fix:** Updated AI prompts (avoid repetition, IC focus)
- **Result:** More diverse, appropriate questions

### 4. Admin Skills Page
- **Issue:** Only showing first 1000 skills (stopped at A's)
- **Fix:** Added .limit(50000) and .order('name')
- **Result:** All 34,863 skills load properly

### 5. Schema Cache Issue
- **Issue:** Supabase client cache not refreshing after migration
- **Fix:** Use individual inserts instead of batch
- **Result:** Questions inserting successfully
