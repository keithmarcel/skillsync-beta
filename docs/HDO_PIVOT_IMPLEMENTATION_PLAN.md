# High-Demand Occupations Pivot - Implementation Plan

**Status:** In Progress  
**Branch:** `feature/high-demand-occupations-updates`  
**Updated:** October 9, 2025  
**Owner:** Keith + Claude

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

Transforming High-Demand Occupations from an assessment entry point into a discovery & intelligence hub that connects regional labor market data with live employer demand.

**Key Terminology:**
- **Jobs** = Overarching bucket (Occupations + Roles)
- **Occupations** = High-demand occupations (HDO) - general job outlines, BLS/O*NET data
- **Roles** = Featured Roles - company-sponsored, employer-paid positions
- **User Flow:** Occupations ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Assessments ‚Üí Role Readiness

---

## Phase 1: UI & Routing Updates

### 1.1 HDO Table (High-Demand Tab)

**‚úÖ REMOVE:**
- Actions menu: "Take Assessment"
- Actions menu: "Upload your resume and take a skills assessment"
- Actions menu: All separators
- Column: **AVG Salary**
- Column: **Role Readiness**

**‚úÖ ADD:**
- **Column: Related Jobs**
  - Display: Badge with count (e.g., "4 Open Roles")
  - Data Source: Count of Featured Roles with matching `soc_code`
  - Click Behavior: Navigate to `/occupations/:id#open-roles` (smooth scroll)
  
- **Column: Education & Training**
  - Display: Badge with count (e.g., "4 Matches")
  - Data Source: Count of programs with overlapping skills
  - Click Behavior: Navigate to `/occupations/:id#programs` (smooth scroll)

**üìù NOTE:** Category/Industry column already exists - no changes needed

---

### 1.2 HDO Details Page (`/occupations/:id`)

**‚úÖ REMOVE:**
- All assessment entry points
- Assessment CTAs from "Start Your Assessment" block

**‚úÖ REFACTOR:**
- **"Start Your Assessment" Block**
  - Update copy to align with new discovery flow
  - Update CTA to relevant action (e.g., "View Related Roles")
  
- **Typical Tasks & Responsibilities Section**
  - Remove scrolling behavior - show all tasks
  - Remove "Importance" lines from all tasks

**‚úÖ ADD/REORGANIZE:**

1. **Trusted Partners Block** (Move to top)
   - Position: Above "Employers Hiring Now"
   - Refactor copy: "Trusted Partners in your area are hiring for this occupation"
   
2. **Employers Hiring Now Section** (New - repurpose Related Job Titles design)
   - Position: Above "Skills and Responsibilities"
   - Break out of Skills container into own section
   - Display: Featured Roles with matching `soc_code`
   - Each card shows: Company logo, role title, "View Details" button
   - Links to: `/jobs/:roleId`
   - Empty state: "No active roles currently match this occupation"
   - Anchor ID: `#open-roles`

3. **Relevant Programs Section** (New)
   - Display: Programs with overlapping skills
   - Each card shows:
     - Program Title
     - Provider Name
     - Skill Overlap Count ("8 skills in common")
     - "View Program" button ‚Üí `/programs/:id`
   - Empty state: "No matching programs currently available in your region"
   - Anchor ID: `#programs`

4. **CareerOneStop Video** (Keep existing)
   - **Enhancement:** Try creating iframe modal with video
   - Pull video info from CareerOneStop page

5. **Data Source Footer** (New)
   - Text: "Data source: BLS 2022; CareerOneStop; O*NET"
   - Links open in new tab
   - Position: Bottom of page

---

## Phase 2: Backend & Schema

### 2.1 Skills Extractor Strategy

**‚ùå DO NOT DUPLICATE** the extractor code

**‚úÖ EXTEND** existing extractor to support both contexts:

```
Current: skills_extractor ‚Üí high_demand_occupations.soc_code
New: skills_extractor ‚Üí (high_demand_occupations.soc_code + featured_roles.soc_code)
```

**Key Challenge - Two Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Curated HDO Skills ‚Üí Featured Role**
- Admin curates skills for SOC code via HDO pipeline
- Same SOC code used for Featured Role
- **Question:** Should Featured Role inherit exact same curated skills?

**Scenario 2: Employer Customization**
- Employer views curated skills for their role's SOC
- Wants to modify/add skills specific to their company
- **Question:** How do we maintain crosswalk integrity after customization?

**Proposed Solution (TBD):**
- Option A: Threshold-based overlap (e.g., 70% match still shows crosswalk)
- Option B: Separate "base skills" (SOC-level) vs "custom skills" (role-level)
- Option C: Track "skill drift" and show partial matches

**üîç INVESTIGATION NEEDED:** Determine best approach for skill inheritance vs customization

---

### 2.2 Schema Investigation Required

**Tasks:**
1. **Audit `featured_roles` table in live Supabase:**
   - Does `soc_code` field exist?
   - Does `skills` field exist? (JSONB or relation to `job_skills`?)
   - Does `related_program_ids` exist?
   - Current data state - are SOC codes populated?

2. **Audit `jobs` table:**
   - Relationship to `featured_roles`
   - Current skills storage mechanism
   - Assessment linkage

3. **Check existing crosswalk logic:**
   - Any existing SOC crosswalk tables/views?
   - Current skill overlap queries?
   - Performance implications

**Expected Schema Additions:**
```sql
-- If missing, add to featured_roles:
ALTER TABLE featured_roles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS soc_code TEXT;
ALTER TABLE featured_roles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS required_proficiency_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 90;
ALTER TABLE featured_roles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS auto_invite_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 90;
ALTER TABLE featured_roles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS skills JSONB;
ALTER TABLE featured_roles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS related_program_ids TEXT[];

-- Indexes for crosswalk performance:
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_featured_roles_soc ON featured_roles(soc_code);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_high_demand_occupations_soc ON high_demand_occupations(soc_code);
```

---

### 2.3 SOC Code Generation Script

**Need:** AI script to analyze existing Featured Roles and assign correct SOC codes

**Current State:** Mock Featured Roles may have incorrect/fake SOC codes

**Script Requirements:**
1. Analyze job title + description
2. Match to appropriate SOC code from O*NET taxonomy
3. One-time execution for existing roles
4. **Save script for reuse** in admin role editor

**Future Integration:**
- Add "Generate SOC Code" button to admin role editor
- Auto-suggest SOC code when creating new Featured Role
- Allow manual override

---

### 2.4 Crosswalk Logic Architecture

**Requirements:**
- Fast response time
- Scalable (growing Featured Roles + HDO)
- No tech debt

**Options to Evaluate:**

**Option A: Database View**
```sql
CREATE VIEW soc_crosswalk AS
SELECT 
  hdo.soc_code,
  COUNT(DISTINCT fr.id) as featured_roles_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) as programs_count
FROM high_demand_occupations hdo
LEFT JOIN featured_roles fr ON fr.soc_code = hdo.soc_code
LEFT JOIN programs p ON p.skills && hdo.skills
GROUP BY hdo.soc_code;
```

**Option B: Materialized View** (refresh periodically)

**Option C: Real-time Query** (with proper indexes)

**üîç INVESTIGATION NEEDED:** Performance testing with current data volume

---

### 2.5 Admin Tools Audit

**Tasks:**
1. **Review current admin role editor** (`/admin/roles/[id]`)
   - Does it have SOC code field?
   - Are all user-facing fields editable?
   - Image upload functionality?
   - Multi-select for categories?
   - Ability to add new categories?

2. **Required Fields Checklist:**
   - [ ] Role Title (editable)
   - [ ] Description (editable)
   - [ ] SOC Code (editable with auto-suggest)
   - [ ] Category (multi-select)
   - [ ] Employment Type (dropdown)
   - [ ] Salary Range (editable)
   - [ ] Location (editable)
   - [ ] Skills (multi-select with add new)
   - [ ] Responsibilities (rich text)
   - [ ] Education Requirements (dropdown)
   - [ ] Company Logo (upload)
   - [ ] Role Image (upload)
   - [ ] Trusted Partner Badge (checkbox)

3. **Skills Extraction Trigger:**
   - Currently: Manual
   - Add: "Extract Skills from SOC" button
   - Behavior: Pulls curated skills for selected SOC code
   - Allow: Manual editing after extraction

---

## Phase 3: Data Migration & Cleanup

### 3.1 Featured Roles Data Audit

**Tasks:**
1. Export current Featured Roles data
2. Validate SOC codes (real vs mock)
3. Run SOC generation script
4. Backup existing skills data
5. Re-run skills extraction pipeline with correct SOC codes

### 3.2 Skills Data Strategy

**Current State:** Featured Role skills exist but will be replaced

**Migration Plan:**
1. Backup existing `job_skills` data
2. Run skills extractor on correct SOC codes
3. Admin curates extracted skills
4. Populate Featured Roles with curated skills
5. Test crosswalk logic
