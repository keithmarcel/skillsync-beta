## üéâ **COMPLETED: O*NET Data Enrichment & Performance Optimization (October 9, 2025)**

### **What Was Delivered**

**1. Unified O*NET Enrichment Pipeline** ‚úÖ
- **Script:** `scripts/enrich-jobs-onet.js` (replaces old featured-roles-only script)
- **Real O*NET Data:** Fetches from O*NET Web Services API (tasks, tools)
- **AI Refinement:** GPT-4o-mini refines for conciseness and professionalism
- **Content Differentiation:** Strategic responsibilities vs tactical tasks
- **Gap Filling:** AI adds industry-standard tools when O*NET data is incomplete

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ All 8 Featured Roles enriched with real O*NET + AI refinement
- ‚úÖ All 30 HDOs enriched with real O*NET + AI refinement
- ‚úÖ 6-8 strategic responsibilities per job (outcome-focused)
- ‚úÖ 10-12 tactical tasks per job (action-focused)
- ‚úÖ 5-12 tools per job (categorized: Software/Equipment/Technology)

**2. Performance Optimization** ‚úÖ
- **Problem:** N+1 query anti-pattern (91 queries for HDO tab = 3-5s load time)
- **Solution:** Batch queries with in-memory joins using Map structures
- **Results:**
  - Featured Roles: 9 queries ‚Üí 2 queries (78% reduction)
  - HDOs: 91 queries ‚Üí 4 queries (96% reduction)

### Sprint 4.1: Invitations V2 Refactor (October 15, 2025) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Branch:** `main`  
**Duration:** 4 hours  
**Documentation:** [INVITATIONS_V2_REFACTOR_COMPLETE.md](./features/INVITATIONS_V2_REFACTOR_COMPLETE.md)
