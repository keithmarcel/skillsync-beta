**Completed:** October 21, 2025 1:30 AM  
**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Branch:** `main` (direct commits)

### Problem Solved
Fixed critical data integrity issues in Skills Snapshot where metrics didn't match actual assessment data due to:
- Inconsistent enum naming across database, code, and UI

- Missing skill names in queries causing "Unknown Skill" display

### Deliverables

- ‚úÖ **Database Migration**: `20251021000000_standardize_skill_band_enum.sql` applied
