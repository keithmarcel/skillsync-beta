# Employer Invitation System - Detailed Specification

**Branch:** `feature/employer-invitations`  
**Duration:** 3-4 days  
**Priority:** HIGH - Core marketplace feature  
**Dependencies:** Multi-role auth, user account settings  
**Status:** Awaiting mockups and decision on flow

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Enable employers to discover qualified candidates and invite them to apply for roles, creating a direct pipeline from assessment to employment.

---

## Flow Decision Required

### Option A: User-Initiated Submission
**Flow:**
1. User completes assessment
2. If score >= threshold, "Submit to Employer" button appears
3. User clicks to submit assessment to employer
4. Employer sees submission in dashboard
5. Employer reviews and sends invitation
6. User receives invitation notification

**Pros:**
- User has explicit control
- Clear consent
- User chooses which assessments to share

**Cons:**
- Extra friction (user must take action)
- Fewer candidates visible to employers
- Users might not know to submit

---

### Option B: Auto-Visible with Opt-Out (RECOMMENDED)
**Flow:**
1. User completes assessment
2. If score >= threshold, automatically visible to employer
3. Employer browses qualified candidates
4. Employer sends invitation directly
5. User receives invitation notification

**With Privacy Control:**
- User setting: "Make my assessments visible to employers" (default: ON)
- User can opt-out globally or per-assessment
- Clear privacy messaging during assessment

**Pros:**
- Simpler user experience
- More candidates visible to employers
- Better marketplace liquidity
- User still has control via settings

**Cons:**
- Requires clear privacy messaging
- Need opt-out mechanism

**RECOMMENDATION:** Option B with privacy settings

---

## Proficiency Threshold Decision

### Option 1: Single Threshold (RECOMMENDED)
**Example:** 85%

- User sees "Role Ready" if score >= 85%
- Employer sees candidate if score >= 85%
- Employer sets threshold per role
- Simple, clear, no confusion

### Option 2: Dual Threshold
**Example:** Display 90%, Visibility 85%

- User sees "Role Ready" if score >= 90%
- Employer sees candidate if score >= 85%
- Allows employers to see "close" candidates
- More complex, potentially confusing

**RECOMMENDATION:** Single threshold (85% default, employer configurable)

## Database Schema

### Employer Invitations Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE employer_invitations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  employer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  candidate_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  job_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES jobs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  assessment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES assessments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  application_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT,
  status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'viewed', 'applied', 'declined', 'archived')),
  sent_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  viewed_at TIMESTAMP,
  responded_at TIMESTAMP,
  response_type VARCHAR CHECK (response_type IN ('applied', 'declined')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employer_invitations_candidate ON employer_invitations(candidate_id, status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employer_invitations_employer ON employer_invitations(employer_id, job_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employer_invitations_status ON employer_invitations(status);

-- Prevent duplicate invitations
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_unique_invitation 
ON employer_invitations(employer_id, candidate_id, job_id, assessment_id)
WHERE status NOT IN ('declined', 'archived');
```

### Jobs Table Updates

```sql
-- Add proficiency threshold to jobs
ALTER TABLE jobs
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS proficiency_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 85 CHECK (proficiency_threshold BETWEEN 0 AND 100);
```

### Profiles Table Updates

```sql
-- Add privacy setting
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS visible_to_employers BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
```

### Assessment Submissions (If Using Option A)

```sql
CREATE TABLE assessment_submissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  assessment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES assessments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  job_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES jobs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'reviewed', 'invited', 'rejected'))
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assessment_submissions_job ON assessment_submissions(job_id, status);
```
