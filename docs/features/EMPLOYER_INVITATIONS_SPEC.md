# Employer Invitation System - Detailed Specification

**Branch:** `feature/employer-invitations`  
**Duration:** 3-4 days  
**Priority:** HIGH - Core marketplace feature  
**Dependencies:** Multi-role auth, user account settings  
**Status:** Awaiting mockups and decision on flow

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Enable employers to discover qualified candidates and invite them to apply for roles, creating a direct pipeline from assessment to employment.

---

## âœ… Flow Decision: Option B - Auto-Visible with Opt-Out

**APPROVED FLOW:**
1. User completes assessment
2. If score >= visibility threshold (85%), automatically visible to employer
3. Employer browses qualified candidates
4. Employer sends invitation directly
5. User receives invitation notification

**Privacy Control:**
- User setting: "Make my assessments visible to employers" (default: ON)
- User can opt-out globally in settings
- Clear privacy messaging during assessment
- Transparent about when results are visible

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Simpler user experience
- âœ… More candidates visible to employers
- âœ… Better marketplace liquidity
- âœ… User still has control via settings

---

## âœ… Proficiency Threshold: Dual Threshold System

**APPROVED APPROACH:**

**Display Threshold:** 90%
- User sees "Role Ready" badge if score >= 90%
- Shown in assessment results
- Clear achievement milestone

**Visibility Threshold:** 85%
- Employer sees candidate if score >= 85%
- Gives employers more candidates to choose from
- Allows discovery of "close" candidates (85-89%)

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Employers get larger candidate pool
- âœ… Users have clear goal (90% = Role Ready)
- âœ… Flexibility for employers to evaluate near-qualified candidates
- âœ… Both thresholds configurable per role by employer

**Implementation:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE jobs
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS display_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 90,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS visibility_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 85;
```

**User Experience:**
- Score 85-89%: "Building Proficiency" (visible to employers)
- Score 90%+: "Role Ready" (visible to employers)
- Score <85%: "Keep Learning" (not visible to employers)

## Database Schema

### Employer Invitations Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE employer_invitations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  employer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  candidate_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  job_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES jobs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  assessment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES assessments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  application_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT,
  status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'viewed', 'applied', 'declined', 'archived')),
  sent_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  viewed_at TIMESTAMP,
  responded_at TIMESTAMP,
  response_type VARCHAR CHECK (response_type IN ('applied', 'declined')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employer_invitations_candidate ON employer_invitations(candidate_id, status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employer_invitations_employer ON employer_invitations(employer_id, job_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employer_invitations_status ON employer_invitations(status);

-- Prevent duplicate invitations
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_unique_invitation 
ON employer_invitations(employer_id, candidate_id, job_id, assessment_id)
WHERE status NOT IN ('declined', 'archived');
```

### Jobs Table Updates

```sql
-- Add dual proficiency thresholds to jobs
ALTER TABLE jobs
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS display_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 90 CHECK (display_threshold BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS visibility_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 85 CHECK (visibility_threshold BETWEEN 0 AND 100);

-- Ensure visibility <= display
ALTER TABLE jobs
ADD CONSTRAINT visibility_lte_display CHECK (visibility_threshold <= display_threshold);
```

### Profiles Table Updates

```sql
-- Add privacy setting
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS visible_to_employers BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
```

### Assessment Submissions (If Using Option A)

```sql
CREATE TABLE assessment_submissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  assessment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES assessments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  job_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES jobs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'reviewed', 'invited', 'rejected'))
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assessment_submissions_job ON assessment_submissions(job_id, status);
```
