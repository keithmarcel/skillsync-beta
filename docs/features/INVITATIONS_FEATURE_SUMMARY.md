## ⏸️ On Hold: Employer UI

The employer-side UI is intentionally on hold as it will be part of a larger employer admin dashboard. The backend is fully ready:

**Ready for Implementation:**
- API endpoints for candidate pool management
- Service functions for sending invitations
- Bulk actions for employer operations
- RLS policies for employer access

**To Be Built (Future):**
- Employer dashboard layout
- Candidates table with filters
- "Invite to Apply" button and flow
- Bulk invitation sending
- Candidate status management

---

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### RLS Policies

**Candidates:**
- Can view their own invitations only
- Can update their own invitations (mark applied/declined/archived)
- Cannot see other candidates' invitations

**Employer Admins:**
- Can view candidates for their company only
- Can send invitations to qualified candidates
- Can update invitation status (hired/unqualified/archived)
- Scoped by `profiles.company_id`

**Super Admins:**
- Full access to all invitations
- Can manage any invitation status

---

## 📝 Notes

### Migration Execution Order
1. `20251002141922_multi_role_auth_schema.sql` - Adds enum values
2. `20251002145900_update_existing_roles.sql` - Updates existing data
3. `20251002145950_multi_role_schema_extensions.sql` - Adds constraints
4. `20251002145100_employer_invitations_system.sql` - Creates invitation system

**Critical:** PostgreSQL requires enum values to be committed before use in constraints.

### Known Limitations
- 30-second polling for notifications (not true real-time)
- Company logos may not display if logo_url is null
- Employer UI on hold pending larger dashboard implementation
