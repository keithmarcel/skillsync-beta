# Mobile Epic: App-Wide Responsive Design

## Overview
Comprehensive mobile optimization across the entire SkillSync application, ensuring a seamless experience from 375px (iPhone SE) to 1440px+ (desktop). This epic addresses responsive design, touch interactions, and mobile-first UX patterns.

## Scope
- **Main App**: Jobs, Programs, Assessments, Profile
- **Employer Dashboard**: Invites, Roles, Settings
- **Provider Dashboard**: Programs, Students
- **Admin Dashboard**: All management tables
- **Shared Components**: Navigation, Modals, Forms, Tables

---

## 1. Employer Dashboard - Invites Table

### Current State (Temporary Solution)
**Desktop (768px+):** Horizontal scroll table with sticky Name and Actions columns  
**Mobile (<768px):** Card layout with vertical stacking

### Issues to Address

### 1. **Horizontal Scroll UX (504px - 768px)**
- ❌ Limited finger space makes horizontal scrolling difficult
- ❌ Status column still peeks under Actions column
- ❌ Role Readiness column goes off-screen
- ❌ Touch targets too small for comfortable interaction
- ❌ Not optimized for natural vertical scrolling behavior

### 2. **Search & Filter Controls**
- ❌ Stack vertically on mobile but take up too much space
- ❌ No mobile-optimized filter drawer/modal
- ❌ Sort dropdown hard to use with small touch targets

### 3. **Card Layout (Current Temp Solution)**
- ✅ Shows all data vertically
- ⚠️ Basic implementation - needs refinement
- ⚠️ No swipe gestures
- ⚠️ No progressive disclosure
- ⚠️ Actions dropdown could be better optimized

### 4. **Performance**
- ⚠️ Renders both table and cards (hidden via CSS)
- ⚠️ Could optimize by conditionally rendering based on viewport

## Recommended Improvements for Mobile Epic

### **Phase 1: Enhanced Card Layout**
- [ ] Swipe gestures for quick actions (swipe left to archive, swipe right to view)
- [ ] Collapsible card sections (tap to expand/collapse details)
- [ ] Larger touch targets (minimum 44x44px)
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh functionality
- [ ] Skeleton loading states

### **Phase 2: Mobile-First Filtering**
- [ ] Bottom sheet filter drawer (slides up from bottom)
- [ ] Chip-based active filters with easy removal
- [ ] Quick filter buttons (All, Pending, Sent, Applied, etc.)
- [ ] Search with autocomplete/suggestions
- [ ] Clear all filters button

### **Phase 3: Optimized Actions**
- [ ] Bottom action sheet instead of dropdown
- [ ] Quick action buttons on card (primary actions visible)
- [ ] Confirmation modals optimized for mobile
- [ ] Haptic feedback for actions

### **Phase 4: Performance & Polish**
- [ ] Conditional rendering (don't render both table and cards)
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large lists
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Loading states and error handling
- [ ] Empty states with helpful CTAs

### **Phase 5: Tablet Optimization (768px - 1024px)**
- [ ] 2-column card grid
- [ ] Hybrid view (simplified table or enhanced cards)
- [ ] Better use of horizontal space

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **CSS Media Queries**
   - Current: Simple hide/show at 768px breakpoint
   - Future: Progressive enhancement across breakpoints (375px, 480px, 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1140px)

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Current: Single DataTable component handles both layouts
   - Future: Separate MobileCardView and DesktopTableView components

3. **State Management**
   - Current: All state in parent component
   - Future: Consider useReducer or state management library for complex interactions

4. **Accessibility**
   - [ ] Keyboard navigation for cards
   - [ ] Screen reader announcements for actions
   - [ ] Focus management for modals/drawers
   - [ ] ARIA labels for all interactive elements

## Design Considerations

### **Touch Targets**
- Minimum 44x44px for all tappable elements
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements (8px minimum)

### **Typography**
- Larger font sizes for mobile (16px minimum for body text)
- Increased line height for readability
- Proper text truncation with ellipsis

### **Visual Hierarchy**
- Clear distinction between card sections
- Proper use of whitespace
- Consistent spacing system

### **Gestures**
- Swipe actions with visual feedback
- Pull-to-refresh with loading indicator
- Long-press for additional options
