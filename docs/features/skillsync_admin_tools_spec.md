# SkillSync Admin Tools ‚Äì Extended Spec for Full Entity Data

## üìù Prompt for Claude Sonnet 4

You are to build the SkillSync Admin Tools as described below. Before creating any code or database actions, you **must review the current SkillSync Supabase schema, RLS (Row-Level Security) policies, and app build** to ensure connections are proper and consistent. Any new properties or tables should be created only if they logically extend the current build. All mock data must live only in the database, never in code.

The Admin Tools UI must be **responsive, intuitive, and follow current SkillSync design patterns** (tables, drilldowns, dialogs, media upload, relationships). Ensure all entities a learner sees (Companies, Featured Roles, High-Demand Occupations, Education Providers, Programs, Assessments) can be fully viewed and edited in Admin Tools. Each admin role should only see scoped data per RLS (Super Admin = global, Company Admin = company only, Provider Admin = provider only).

Deliverable: Implement Admin Tools that provide a complete content management view for all user-facing entities, matching the details learners see in Program Details cards, Role Details cards, and Occupation cards. Support safe data management (explicit Save/Cancel, dirty state guard), destructive actions (confirmation dialogs, type-to-confirm for deletes), and strong security (Supabase RLS enforcement, scoped views, no mock data in code). Support AI assessment generation via pipeline, saving results into DB with status=draft for review. Ensure consistency, reusability, and no duplication of data structures.

## üß≠ Admin UI Requirements

### Table Views (per entity)
- Show all key user-facing fields in the grid, not just identifiers.  
  Example: Program grid shows **Program Name, Provider, Format, Duration, Featured, Skills Count**.  
- Bulk actions: feature/unfeature, archive, publish.

### Drilldown Detail Views
- Tabs per entity (Overview, Media, Skills, Relationships, Metadata, History).
- Every field a learner can see must be editable in the admin view.  
- Save/Cancel explicit. Dirty state guard.  

### Relationships
- Add/remove links between entities in **Relationships tab**:
  - Programs ‚Üî Occupations
  - Roles ‚Üî Companies
  - Roles ‚Üî Assessments
  - Providers ‚Üî Programs

### Media
- Upload/replace images/logos with validation (format, size).
- Preview before save.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria (General Pattern)
- **Given** I am a Super Admin  
  **When** I view any entity detail  
  **Then** I can edit every field visible to learners.  
- **When** I click Save  
  **Then** changes persist in DB and update the learner-facing cards and detail views.  
- **When** I attempt a destructive action  
  **Then** I must confirm via dialog before proceeding.

---

## üö® Non-Negotiables
- No field duplication between Admin DB and learner-facing DB: all data must come from the same tables.  
- No mock data in code: seed any placeholder content inside DB tables.  
- Supabase RLS must scope correctly so that:  
  - Super Admin sees global view.  
  - Company Admin sees only their company + roles.  
  - Education Provider Admin sees only their institution + programs.
