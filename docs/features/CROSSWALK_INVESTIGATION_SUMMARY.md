# Crosswalk Investigation Summary - October 20, 2025

**Investigation Date:** October 20, 2025 5:47 PM - 6:24 PM  
**Branch:** `feature/crosswalk-implementation`  
**Status:** ✅ Investigation Complete - Ready for Phase 1 Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

Conducted comprehensive investigation of crosswalk infrastructure to determine implementation requirements. **Major Discovery:** Phase 0 (SOC-based skills for HDOs) is already complete. Architecture is working correctly, data exists, and system is ready for crosswalk count queries.

**Key Finding:** UI structure exists, data architecture works, but crosswalk counts are missing (showing "0"). Implementation can proceed directly to Phase 1.

---

## Investigation Process

### 1. Documentation Review (Following Memory Guidelines)

**Updated Core Documentation:**
- ✅ `HDO_PIVOT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Updated Phase 4A status
- ✅ `SPRINT_ROADMAP.md` - Revised sprint objectives
- ✅ Created `CROSSWALK_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Complete technical plan

**Cross-Referenced:**
- ✅ `skill-sync-technical-architecture.md` (Lines 1871-1874)
- ✅ `HDO_PIVOT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (Lines 244-248)
- ✅ `SKILLS_ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE.md` - Hybrid architecture
- ✅ `SKILLS_TAXONOMY_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Skills sources
- ✅ `SKILLS_MAPPINGS_AND_RELATIONSHIPS.md` - Universal currency

### 2. Remote Database Schema Verification

**Created Verification Script:** `/scripts/check-crosswalk-schema.js`

**Verified Tables:**
```
jobs:           40 total (30 HDOs, 10 Featured Roles)
programs:       222 total
skills:         35,041 total
job_skills:     105 relationships (Featured Roles)
program_skills: 1,843 relationships
soc_skills:     460 relationships (HDOs)
```

**Junction Tables Confirmed:**
- `job_skills` (job_id, skill_id, importance_level) - Featured Roles
- `soc_skills` (soc_code, skill_id, weight, display_order) - Occupations
- `program_skills` (program_id, skill_id, weight, coverage_level) - Programs

### 3. Code Architecture Verification

**Found in `/src/lib/database/queries.ts` (Lines 430-446):**

```typescript
// Check for curated skills ONLY for high-demand occupations (not featured roles)
// Featured roles use job_skills (role-specific), occupations use soc_skills (SOC-based)
if (data?.soc_code && data?.job_kind === 'occupation') {
  const { data: curatedSkills, error: curatedError } = await supabase
    .from('soc_skills')
    .select(`
      weight,
      skills!soc_skills_skill_id_fkey(*)
    `)
    .eq('soc_code', data.soc_code)
    .order('weight', { ascending: false })

  // Use curated skills if they exist
  if (!curatedError && curatedSkills && curatedSkills.length > 0) {
    data.skills = curatedSkills
  }
}
```

**Architecture Confirmed:**
- ✅ Featured Roles: Use `job_skills` junction (customizable, role-specific)
- ✅ Occupations: Use `soc_skills` junction (SOC-based, government baseline)
- ✅ No cross-contamination between architectures
- ✅ `getJobById()` handles both correctly

### 4. Data Verification

**soc_skills Table Status:**
- ✅ 460 records populated
- ✅ Skills mapped to SOC codes
- ✅ Weights assigned (0.75 - 0.95 range)

**Sample HDO Skills Counts:**
- General and Operations Managers (11-1021.00): 10 skills
- Financial Managers (11-3031.00): 15 skills
- Medical and Health Services Managers (11-9111.00): 9 skills
- Property Managers (11-9141.00): 11 skills
- Managers, All Other (11-9199.00): 7 skills

**Featured Roles Status:**
- ✅ All 10 have SOC codes assigned
- ✅ Average 10.5 skills per role
- ✅ Skills in `job_skills` junction
- ✅ Example: Business Development Manager has 18 skills

**Crosswalk Potential Confirmed:**
- SOC 11-9021.00: 3 Mechanical Project Manager roles
  - Assistant Mechanical PM (5 skills)
  - Mechanical PM (5 skills)
  - Senior Mechanical PM (5 skills)

## Key Findings

### ✅ What's Already Working

**1. UI Structure (Complete)**
- HDO table has "Open Roles" and "Programs" columns
- Columns styled correctly (teal pills when >0, gray when 0)
- Click handlers navigate to detail pages with anchors
- HDO detail page has "Local Employers Hiring Now" section
- HDO detail page has "Relevant Programs" section
- Featured Role detail page has "Relevant Programs" section

**Source:** `/src/lib/table-configs.ts` (Lines 241-281)

**2. Skills Architecture (Complete)**
- Hybrid architecture implemented correctly
- Featured Roles: Customizable via `job_skills`
- Occupations: Read-only via `soc_skills`
- `getJobById()` handles both architectures
- No cross-contamination

**Source:** `/src/lib/database/queries.ts` (Lines 403-486)

**3. Database Schema (Complete)**
- All junction tables exist
- Data populated (460 soc_skills, 105 job_skills, 1,843 program_skills)
- SOC codes assigned to all jobs
- Skills mapped to SOC codes

### ❌ What's Missing (Blocker)

**Crosswalk Count Queries:**
- HDO table shows "0 Open Roles" (should show count of Featured Roles with matching SOC)
- HDO table shows "0 Matches" (should show count of Programs with skill overlap)
- Detail page sections show empty states (need data queries)

**Root Cause:**
- `getHighDemandOccupations()` doesn't include crosswalk counts
- No queries exist to fetch related Featured Roles by SOC
- No queries exist to fetch related Programs by skill overlap

---

## Skills Architecture Deep Dive

### Hybrid Architecture (from SKILLS_ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE.md)

**Design Decision:**
- **Problem:** Featured Roles sharing same SOC had identical skills (no seniority differentiation)
- **Solution:** Split into two architectures

**High-Demand Occupations:**
- Read-only baseline from `soc_skills` table
- Filtered by SOC code
- Maintains government data integrity (O*NET/Lightcast)
- Cannot be customized
- Updated when SOC data refreshed

**Featured Roles:**
- Role-specific from `job_skills` junction
- Fully customizable per role
- Allows seniority-level differentiation
- No cross-contamination with other roles
- Employers can add specialized skills

### Skills as Universal Currency (from SKILLS_MAPPINGS_AND_RELATIONSHIPS.md)

**Architecture:**
```
                    SKILLS
                   /  |  \
                  /   |   \
                 /    |    \
          JOBS ←──────┼──────→ PROGRAMS
               ↗      |      ↙
          USERS ←─────┼─────→ ASSESSMENTS
```

**Direct Relationships:**
- Jobs ↔ Skills: What skills are required
- Programs ↔ Skills: What skills programs teach
- Assessments ↔ Skills: What skills are tested
- Users ↔ Skills: What skills users have

**Derived Relationships (Crosswalk):**
- Jobs ↔ Programs: Via shared skills (gap filling)
- Jobs ↔ Users: Via skill matching (job readiness)
- Programs ↔ Users: Via skill gaps (education recommendations)

## Crosswalk Logic

### 1. HDO → Featured Roles (SOC Code Match)

**Simple JOIN Query:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM jobs 
WHERE job_kind = 'featured_role' 
  AND soc_code = [HDO.soc_code]
  AND is_published = true
```

**Performance:** Fast (indexed on soc_code)

**Example:**
- HDO: General and Operations Managers (11-1021.00)
- Featured Roles: Count all Featured Roles with SOC 11-1021.00

### 2. HDO → Programs (Skill Overlap)

**Complex Query with Threshold:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p.id, p.name, COUNT(DISTINCT ps.skill_id) as shared_skills_count
FROM programs p
INNER JOIN program_skills ps ON p.id = ps.program_id
WHERE ps.skill_id IN (
  SELECT skill_id 
  FROM soc_skills 
  WHERE soc_code = [HDO.soc_code]
)
GROUP BY p.id, p.name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ps.skill_id) >= [THRESHOLD]
ORDER BY shared_skills_count DESC
```

**Threshold Options:**
- 1 skill: Broad matching (may include irrelevant programs)
- 3 skills: Moderate matching (recommended starting point)
- 5 skills: Strict matching (may exclude relevant programs)

**Performance:** Moderate (needs optimization/caching)

### 3. Featured Role → HDOs (Reverse SOC Match)

**Simple Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM jobs 
WHERE job_kind = 'occupation' 
  AND soc_code = [FeaturedRole.soc_code]
```

### 4. Featured Role → Programs (Skill Overlap)

**Same as HDO → Programs but using job_skills:**
```sql
WHERE ps.skill_id IN (
  SELECT skill_id 
  FROM job_skills 
  WHERE job_id = [FeaturedRole.id]
)
```

### 5. Featured Role → Similar Roles (SOC Match)

**Simple Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM jobs 
WHERE job_kind = 'featured_role' 
  AND soc_code = [FeaturedRole.soc_code]
  AND id != [FeaturedRole.id]
  AND is_published = true
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Count Queries (Day 1)

**Objective:** Add crosswalk counts to HDO table

**Tasks:**
1. Add `getOccupationCrosswalkCounts(soc_code)` function
   - Count Featured Roles by SOC
   - Count Programs by skill overlap (threshold: 3)
   - Return: `{ related_jobs_count, related_programs_count }`

2. Modify `getHighDemandOccupations()` query
   - Add subqueries for counts
   - Test performance with 30 occupations
   - Optimize if needed

3. Test with sample data pool
   - Verify counts are accurate
   - Verify badges display correctly
   - Verify click navigation works

**Success Criteria:**
- HDO table shows accurate counts (not 0)
- Badges are clickable
- Navigation works to detail pages

### Phase 2: Detail Page Queries (Day 1-2)

**Objective:** Populate detail page sections with real data

**Tasks:**
1. Add `getRelatedFeaturedRoles(soc_code, limit)` function
   - Query Featured Roles by SOC
   - Return with company data
   - Limit to 6-12 results

2. Add `getRelatedPrograms(skill_ids, limit)` function
   - Query Programs by skill overlap
   - Include shared_skills_count
   - Order by relevance (most shared skills first)
   - Limit to 6-12 results

3. Update HDO detail page
   - Hook up "Local Employers Hiring Now" section
   - Hook up "Relevant Programs" section
   - Remove empty state placeholders
   - Test with sample data

**Success Criteria:**
- Detail pages show related content
- Empty states handled gracefully
- Load More functionality works

### Phase 3: Featured Role Sections (Day 2-3)

**Objective:** Add missing sections to Featured Role detail pages

**Tasks:**
1. Add `getRelatedOccupations(soc_code)` function
2. Add `getSimilarRoles(soc_code, exclude_id, limit)` function
3. Create UI sections matching HDO page styling
4. Add smooth scroll anchors
5. Test with sample data

**Success Criteria:**
- Featured Role pages have all sections
- Styling matches HDO pages
- Smooth scroll works

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Day 3)

**Objective:** Validate accuracy and performance

**Tasks:**
1. Test all crosswalk scenarios with sample data pool
2. Verify count accuracy
3. Test threshold tuning for skill overlap
4. Performance test with full dataset
5. Optimize queries if needed
6. Document any data quality issues

**Success Criteria:**
- Crosswalk counts are accurate
- Queries perform well (<500ms)
- Threshold provides relevant results
- No false positives/negatives

## Technical Considerations

### Performance

**Indexes Needed:**
- `jobs(soc_code)` - For SOC matching
- `job_skills(job_id, skill_id)` - For skill lookups
- `soc_skills(soc_code, skill_id)` - For SOC skill lookups
- `program_skills(skill_id)` - For reverse skill lookups

**Caching Strategy:**
- Cache crosswalk counts (update on data change)
- Consider materialized views for complex queries
- Evaluate need for Phase 4B caching sprint

### Data Quality

**Current State:**
- ✅ Featured Roles: Good coverage (10.5 avg skills)
- ✅ Occupations: Good coverage (7-15 skills per HDO)
- ⚠️ Programs: 1,843 skill relationships but 0 overlap with current jobs
  - May need to verify skill matching logic
  - May need to adjust threshold

**Monitoring:**
- Track crosswalk accuracy
- Monitor false positives/negatives
- Gather user feedback
- Refine matching logic as needed
