- CIP-to-SOC crosswalk exists but extraction is manual
- No automated inheritance from target occupations

**Impact:**
- Program recommendations are generic, not skills-based
- Education matching lacks precision
- Learning pathways can't be automatically generated

**Code Location:** `/src/lib/services/program-skills-extraction.ts` (exists but not automated)

---

### 3.2 Proficiency Level Definitions (Priority: Medium)

**Current State:** Basic framework exists, but no actual definitions

**Problem:**
- Skills have placeholder proficiency levels
- No beginner/intermediate/expert definitions
- Can't provide granular gap analysis

**Impact:**
- Gap analysis is percentage-based only
- Learning recommendations lack specificity
- Progress tracking is limited

**Database:** `skills.proficiency_levels` column exists but empty

---

### 3.3 Question Bank Anti-Cheat System (Priority: Low)

**Current State:** Basic framework implemented, not fully operational

**Problem:**
- Question rotation exists but not used consistently
- Usage tracking implemented but not enforced
- Cheat prevention is theoretical, not practical

**Impact:**
- Assessment integrity could be compromised
- Question quality metrics not tracked
- No analytics on question effectiveness

**Tables:** `quiz_questions` has rotation fields but they're not populated
