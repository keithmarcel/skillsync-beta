**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive legal pages system for SkillSync with complete legal content extracted from official RTF documents, proper integration into signup flow and footer navigation.

## Files Created

### Reusable Component (Single Source of Truth)
- `/src/components/legal/legal-page-content.tsx` - **Reusable legal page component with consistent styling**
  - All legal pages use this component for consistent formatting
  - Single place to update styling across all legal pages
  - Handles typography, spacing, links, and layout

### Legal Pages
- `/src/app/(main)/legal/layout.tsx` - Shared layout with centered logo, 980px container, no navbar
- `/src/app/(main)/legal/terms/page.tsx` - **Terms of Use** (24 sections, complete content from RTF)
- `/src/app/(main)/legal/privacy/page.tsx` - **Privacy Policy** (comprehensive generic policy)
- `/src/app/(main)/legal/user-agreement/page.tsx` - **User Terms of Acceptance** (24 sections, complete content from RTF)

### Source Documents
- `/docs/legal/SkillSync - Terms of Use (1).rtf` - Official Terms of Use source
- `/docs/legal/SkillSync - User Acceptance Agreement (1).rtf` - Official User Agreement source

## Files Modified

### Signup Flow
- `/src/app/(main)/auth/signup/page.tsx`
  - **Step 1:** Updated checkbox to say "I agree to the Terms of Use" with link to `/legal/terms`
  - **Step 2:** Updated privacy text to say "I agree to the Privacy Policy" with link to `/legal/privacy`
  - Changed from external Bisk Amplified links to internal legal pages

### Footer
- `/src/components/ui/footer.tsx`
  - Updated to include three legal links: Terms of Use | User Agreement | Privacy Policy
  - All links open in new tabs (`target="_blank"`)
  - Links point to internal `/legal/*` routes

### Layout Wrapper
- `/src/components/auth/auth-layout-wrapper.tsx`
  - Added legal pages to exclusion list (no navbar/footer wrapper)
  - Legal pages use their own dedicated layout
  - Maintains scrollability for legal content on `/legal/*` routes

## Design Features

### Layout
- **Logo:** Centered SkillSync logo, 48px from page top, no background
- **Container:** 980px max-width with proper padding, no border
- **Background:** Clean white background (no card styling)
- **Typography:** Tailwind-based styling with proper hierarchy
- **Colors:** Teal accent (#0694A2) for links matching brand palette
- **Responsive:** Mobile-friendly with proper padding adjustments
- **Footer:** Uses primary Footer component (single footer, no duplication)

### Accessibility
- All links open in new tabs with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- Clear visual hierarchy with headings
- Readable font sizes and line heights

## Routes Available

- `/legal/terms` - Terms of Use (24 sections, complete legal content)

## Integration Points

### Signup Flow
1. **Step 1 (Account Creation):**
   - Checkbox: "I agree to the Terms of Use" → `/legal/terms`
   
2. **Step 2 (Employer Opt-in):**
   - Text: "Your name and LinkedIn profile ensure accurate identification and reduce recruiter spam. I agree to the Privacy Policy" → `/legal/privacy`

### Footer (Site-wide)
- "© 2025 SkillSync, Powered by Bisk Amplified. All rights reserved. Terms of Use | User Agreement | Privacy Policy"
- All three links open legal pages in new tabs

## Content Status

### Current State ✅
- **Terms of Use:** Complete content extracted from official RTF document (24 sections)
- **User Terms of Acceptance:** Complete content extracted from official RTF document (24 sections)
- **Privacy Policy:** Comprehensive generic policy (10 sections) - ready for customization
- All pages properly formatted with consistent styling
- Last updated dates set to October 20, 2025

### Content Source
- Official RTF documents provided in `/docs/legal/`
- Extracted using `textutil` command-line tool
- All legal language preserved exactly as provided

### Future Considerations
1. Update Privacy Policy with specific business details (addresses, phone numbers)
2. Review all content with legal team for final approval
3. Update last updated dates when content changes
4. Consider adding Cookie Policy if needed for GDPR compliance

## Technical Implementation

### Shared Layout Pattern
```tsx
/legal/layout.tsx
├── Header with logo
├── Main content (800px container)
└── Footer with copyright
```

### Page Structure
```tsx
page.tsx
├── Metadata (title, description)
├── Article wrapper with prose styling
├── H1 heading + last updated date
└── Sections with proper hierarchy
```
