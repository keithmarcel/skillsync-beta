## 🔑 Key Decisions Needed

### 1. Employer Invitation Flow
**Question:** User-initiated submission or auto-visibility?

**Option A: User Submits Assessment**
- Pros: User control, explicit consent
- Cons: Extra step, users might not submit

**Option B: Auto-Visible to Employers**
- Pros: Simpler, more candidates visible
- Cons: Privacy concerns, user might not want visibility

**Recommendation:** **Option B with opt-out**
- Users auto-visible if meet threshold
- Privacy setting: "Make my assessments visible to employers" (default: ON)
- Best of both worlds

### 2. Proficiency Threshold
**Question:** Single or dual threshold?

**Option A: Single Threshold (85%)**
- User sees "Role Ready" at 85%
- Employer sees candidate at 85%
- Simple, clear

**Option B: Dual Threshold**
- Display: 90% (user sees "Role Ready")
- Visibility: 85% (employer sees candidate)
- More nuanced

**Recommendation:** **Single threshold (85%)**
- Simpler for users to understand
- Employers can set their own threshold per role
- Less confusion

### 3. Notification System
**Question:** Supabase or SendGrid?

**Recommendation:** **Start with Supabase**
- Built-in email functionality
- Simpler integration
- Migrate to SendGrid later if needed (better deliverability, templates)

### 4. Account Limits
**Question:** What are the default limits?

**Recommendation:**
- **Provider Admin:** 300 programs max, 50 featured max
- **Employer Admin:** 10 featured roles max
- **Super Admin:** No limits
- Configurable per account

## 📋 Technical Considerations

### Database Migrations Strategy

**Order of migrations:**
1. User roles and profile updates
2. Admin invitations table
3. Employer invitations table
4. Notifications table
5. Company/school profile updates
6. Program RFI submissions

**Approach:** Create one migration per sprint to keep changes grouped

### RLS Policies

**Critical:** Each feature needs proper RLS policies

**Provider Admin:**
- Can read/write programs where school_id = their school_id
- Can read schools where id = their school_id
- Cannot access other providers' data

**Employer Admin:**
- Can read/write jobs where company_id = their company_id
- Can read companies where id = their company_id
- Can read assessments where score >= their threshold
- Cannot access other employers' data

**Super Admin:**
- Can read/write everything
- Special policies for global access

### Storage Buckets

**New buckets needed:**
1. `avatars` - User profile pictures (public read, auth write)
2. `company-logos` - Company/school logos (public read, admin write)

**Configuration:**
- Max file size: 2MB
- Allowed formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
- Auto-resize to standard dimensions

### Email Templates

**Templates needed:**
1. Admin invitation (Provider/Employer)
2. Employer invitation to candidate
3. RFI confirmation (to user)
4. RFI notification (to provider)
5. Assessment completion (optional)
