## Executive Summary

Implement crosswalk queries to connect High-Demand Occupations (HDOs), Featured Roles, and Programs through SOC codes and shared skills. UI structure already exists - need to populate with real data.

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ UI columns exist (Open Roles, Programs)
- ‚úÖ UI sections exist (empty states)
- ‚ùå No data queries (shows 0 counts)

**Goal:** Populate crosswalk UI with accurate counts and data.

## Database Schema (Source of Truth)

**Verified from Remote Supabase Database:** October 20, 2025 6:12 PM

### Tables & Relationships

#### 1. Jobs Table
```
Total Records: 40
- Occupations (HDOs): 30 (job_kind = 'occupation')
- Featured Roles: 10 (job_kind = 'featured_role')

Key Fields:
- id (UUID)
- job_kind (ENUM: 'occupation' | 'featured_role')
- soc_code (TEXT) - SOC classification code
- title (TEXT)
- company_id (UUID) - For featured roles
- skills_count (INTEGER)
```

#### 2. Programs Table
```
Total Records: 222

Key Fields:
- id (UUID)
- name (TEXT)
- cip_code (TEXT) - CIP classification code
- school_id (UUID)
- program_type (TEXT)
- skills_count (INTEGER)
```

#### 3. Skills Table
```
Total Records: 35,041

Key Fields:
- id (UUID)

## Crosswalk Logic

### 1. HDO ‚Üí Featured Roles (SOC Code Match)

**Query Logic:**
```sql
-- Count Featured Roles with matching SOC code
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM jobs 
WHERE job_kind = 'featured_role' 
  AND soc_code = [HDO.soc_code]
  AND is_published = true
```

**Current Data:**
- Sample HDO: "Software Developers" (SOC: 15-1252.00)
- Related Featured Roles: 0 (no Featured Roles with matching SOC yet)

**Action Needed:** Ensure Featured Roles have SOC codes assigned

### 2. HDO ‚Üí Programs (Skill Overlap)

**Query Logic:**
```sql
-- Find programs that teach skills required by HDO
SELECT DISTINCT p.id, p.name, COUNT(DISTINCT ps.skill_id) as shared_skills_count
FROM programs p
INNER JOIN program_skills ps ON p.id = ps.program_id
WHERE ps.skill_id IN (
  SELECT skill_id 
  FROM job_skills 
  WHERE job_id = [HDO.id]
)
GROUP BY p.id, p.name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ps.skill_id) >= [THRESHOLD]
ORDER BY shared_skills_count DESC
```

**Threshold Options:**
- Minimum 1 shared skill (broad matching)
- Minimum 3 shared skills (moderate matching)
- Minimum 5 shared skills (strict matching)

**Current Data:**
- job_skills: 105 relationships
- program_skills: 1,843 relationships
- Potential for crosswalk exists

### 3. Featured Role ‚Üí HDOs (Reverse SOC Match)

**Query Logic:**
```sql
-- Find HDOs with matching SOC code
SELECT * 
FROM jobs 
WHERE job_kind = 'occupation' 
  AND soc_code = [FeaturedRole.soc_code]
```

### 4. Featured Role ‚Üí Programs (Skill Overlap)

**Same logic as HDO ‚Üí Programs** (uses job_skills junction)

### 5. Featured Role ‚Üí Similar Roles (SOC Match)

**Query Logic:**
```sql
-- Find other Featured Roles with same SOC code
SELECT * 
FROM jobs 
WHERE job_kind = 'featured_role' 
  AND soc_code = [FeaturedRole.soc_code]
  AND id != [FeaturedRole.id]
  AND is_published = true
```

---

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 0: SOC-Based Skills for HDOs (PREREQUISITE)

**Critical Discovery:** HDOs have 0 skills because SOC-based lookup not implemented

**Database Structure Verified:**
- ‚úÖ `soc_skills` junction table exists (soc_code, skill_id, weight, display_order)
- ‚úÖ `skills` table has O*NET skills with onet_id
- ‚úÖ Featured Roles use `job_skills` junction (role-specific)
- ‚ùå HDOs need to query `soc_skills` junction by SOC code

**From Technical Architecture Doc (Line 1871-1874):**
> "Occupations use `soc_skills` table but job details expected `job_skills` structure.
> Solution: Updated `getJobById` to handle both featured roles (`job_skills`) and 
> occupations (`soc_skills`) via SOC code lookup."

**From HDO Pivot Plan (Line 244-248):**
> "Skills Inheritance: Query checks `soc_skills` FIRST, then `job_skills`.
> Featured Roles automatically inherit curated SOC skills.
> Employers can add custom skills via `job_skills`."

**‚úÖ STATUS VERIFIED:** `getJobById` ALREADY IMPLEMENTS THIS!

**Code Found in `/src/lib/database/queries.ts` (Lines 430-446):**
```typescript
// Check for curated skills ONLY for high-demand occupations (not featured roles)
// Featured roles use job_skills (role-specific), occupations use soc_skills (SOC-based)
if (data?.soc_code && data?.job_kind === 'occupation') {
  const { data: curatedSkills, error: curatedError } = await supabase
    .from('soc_skills')
    .select(`
      weight,
      skills!soc_skills_skill_id_fkey(*)
    `)
    .eq('soc_code', data.soc_code)
    .order('weight', { ascending: false })

  // Use curated skills if they exist
  if (!curatedError && curatedSkills && curatedSkills.length > 0) {
    data.skills = curatedSkills
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ Architecture Already Correct:**
- ‚úÖ Featured Roles: Query `job_skills` junction (lines 409-412)
- ‚úÖ Occupations: Query `soc_skills` by SOC code (lines 432-446)
- ‚úÖ No cross-contamination between architectures

**‚úÖ PHASE 0 COMPLETE - DATA VERIFIED!**

**soc_skills Table Status (Verified October 20, 2025 6:19 PM):**
- ‚úÖ 460 records in soc_skills table
- ‚úÖ HDOs have skills mapped:
  - General and Operations Managers (11-1021.00): 10 skills
  - Financial Managers (11-3031.00): 15 skills
  - Medical and Health Services Managers (11-9111.00): 9 skills
  - Property Managers (11-9141.00): 11 skills
  - Managers, All Other (11-9199.00): 7 skills

**‚úÖ Architecture Working:**
- Code implements SOC-based lookup for occupations
- Data exists in soc_skills table
- SOC codes match between tables

**Why HDO table shows "0 skills":**
- Table query (`getHighDemandOccupations()`) doesn't include skills
- Only detail page (`getJobById()`) fetches skills
- This is by design - table doesn't need to show skills, just counts

**Conclusion:** Phase 0 is COMPLETE. Ready to implement crosswalk queries!

---

### Phase 1: Count Queries (Day 1)

**File:** `/src/lib/database/queries.ts`

- [ ] Add `getOccupationCrosswalkCounts(soc_code)` function
  - Returns: `{ related_jobs_count, related_programs_count }`
- [ ] Modify `getHighDemandOccupations()` to include counts
  - Add subqueries for counts
  - Test performance with 30 occupations
- [ ] Add `getFeaturedRoleCrosswalkCounts(soc_code, job_id)` function
  - Returns: `{ related_occupations_count, similar_roles_count, related_programs_count }`

### Phase 2: Detail Page Queries (Day 1-2)

**File:** `/src/lib/database/queries.ts`

- [ ] Add `getRelatedFeaturedRoles(soc_code, limit)` function
  - Returns Featured Roles with matching SOC
- [ ] Add `getRelatedPrograms(skill_ids, limit)` function
  - Returns Programs with skill overlap
  - Includes shared_skills_count
- [ ] Add `getRelatedOccupations(soc_code)` function
  - Returns HDOs with matching SOC
- [ ] Add `getSimilarRoles(soc_code, exclude_id, limit)` function
  - Returns other Featured Roles with same SOC

### Phase 3: UI Integration (Day 2)

**Files:**
- `/src/app/(main)/jobs/page.tsx` - HDO table
- `/src/app/(main)/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` - Detail pages

- [ ] Update HDO table data fetching to include counts
- [ ] Update HDO detail page to fetch related data
- [ ] Update Featured Role detail page to fetch related data
- [ ] Remove empty state placeholders
- [ ] Test with real data

### Phase 4: Sample Data Pool (Day 3)

- [ ] Select 3-5 occupations with existing skills
- [ ] Assign SOC codes to Featured Roles (if missing)
- [ ] Verify skill relationships exist
- [ ] Test crosswalk accuracy
- [ ] Document any data quality issues

---

## Data Quality Considerations

### Current State (Verified October 20, 2025 6:18 PM):

**‚úÖ Featured Roles:**
- All 10 Featured Roles have SOC codes assigned
- Average: 10.5 skills per role (good coverage)
- Skills stored in `job_skills` junction table (role-specific)
- Example: "Business Development Manager" has 18 skills

**‚ùå High-Demand Occupations (HDOs):**
- 30 Occupations have 0 skills assigned
- Should use SOC-based skills from `skills` table
- **BLOCKER:** Need to populate HDO skills before crosswalk works

**‚úÖ Crosswalk Potential Exists:**
- Example: 3 Mechanical Project Manager roles share SOC 11-9021.00
- Can crosswalk between these roles once HDO skills populated

### Critical Gap Identified:

**HDOs use SOC-based skills architecture:**
- HDOs should read skills directly from `skills` table filtered by SOC
- Featured Roles use `job_skills` junction table (customizable)
- HDOs currently have 0 skills because SOC-based lookup not implemented
- Need to implement SOC-based skills query for HDOs

### Skills Architecture (from SKILLS_ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE.md):

**High-Demand Occupations:**
- Read-only baseline from `skills` table
- Filtered by SOC code
- Maintains government data integrity
- Cannot be customized

**Featured Roles:**
- Role-specific from `job_skills` junction
- Fully customizable per role
- Allows seniority differentiation
- No cross-contamination

### Recommendations:

1. **CRITICAL - Before implementing crosswalk queries:**
   - ‚úÖ Featured Roles already have SOC codes and skills (10.5 avg)
   - ‚ùå HDOs need SOC-based skills implementation
   - ‚ùå Need to verify `skills` table has SOC code field
   - ‚ùå Need to implement SOC-based skills lookup for HDOs
   - ‚ùå Programs have 1,843 skill relationships but 0 overlap with current jobs

2. **Sample Data Pool Strategy:**
   - Select occupations with matching Featured Role SOC codes:
     - SOC 11-9021.00: 3 Mechanical Project Manager roles (Assistant, Mid, Senior)
     - SOC 11-2022.00: Business Development Manager (18 skills)
     - SOC 13-2051.00: Senior Financial Analyst
   - Ensure these HDOs get SOC-based skills populated
   - Test crosswalk between HDO ‚Üí Featured Roles (SOC match)
   - Test crosswalk between Jobs ‚Üí Programs (skill overlap)

3. **Implementation Priority:**
   - Phase 0: Implement SOC-based skills for HDOs (prerequisite)
   - Phase 1: SOC-based crosswalk (HDO ‚Üî Featured Roles)
   - Phase 2: Skill-based crosswalk (Jobs ‚Üî Programs)
   - Phase 3: UI integration and testing

---

## Testing Strategy

### Sample Data Pool:

**Select 3-5 occupations with:**
1. Known SOC codes
2. Existing skills in job_skills
3. Featured Roles with matching SOC (or create them)
4. Programs with overlapping skills

**Example Candidates:**
- Software Developers (15-1252.00)
- Project Managers (11-9141.00)
- Accountants (13-2011.00)

### Test Cases:

1. **HDO Table:**
   - Verify counts display correctly
   - Verify badges are clickable
   - Verify navigation to detail page

2. **HDO Detail Page:**
   - Verify Featured Roles section populates
   - Verify Programs section populates
   - Verify empty states when no matches

3. **Featured Role Detail Page:**
   - Verify Related Occupations section
   - Verify Similar Roles section
   - Verify Programs section

---

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization:

1. **Indexes Needed:**
   - `jobs(soc_code)` - For SOC matching
   - `job_skills(job_id, skill_id)` - For skill lookups
   - `program_skills(skill_id)` - For reverse skill lookups

2. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Cache crosswalk counts (update on data change)
   - Consider materialized views for complex queries
   - Evaluate need for Phase 4B caching sprint

3. **Query Limits:**
   - Limit detail page results (e.g., 6-12 items)
   - Implement "Load More" for large result sets
   - Use pagination for performance

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] HDO table shows accurate counts (not 0)
- [ ] Counts match actual related records
- [ ] Detail pages show relevant related content
- [ ] Performance: Queries complete in <500ms
- [ ] Empty states handled gracefully
- [ ] Sample data pool validates accuracy

## üîÑ ENHANCEMENTS IN PROGRESS

### Phase 4: Relevance Scoring (Current)

**Goal:** Sort programs by relevance instead of just limiting to top 30.

**Current Behavior:**
- Programs limited to 30 via `program_jobs` junction
- No sorting by relevance - just database order
- All programs treated equally

**Proposed Enhancement:**

#### Relevance Scoring Algorithm

**Factors to Consider:**
1. **CIP-SOC Crosswalk Strength** (40% weight)
   - Primary CIP-SOC match: 1.0
   - Secondary CIP-SOC match: 0.7
   - Tertiary match: 0.4
   - Source: CIP-SOC crosswalk data (if available in DB)

2. **Program Level Match** (20% weight)
   - Certificate for entry-level roles: 1.0
   - Associate's for mid-level: 0.9
   - Bachelor's for senior roles: 1.0
   - Graduate degree for executive: 1.0
   - Mismatch: 0.5

3. **Skills Overlap** (30% weight)
   - Calculate: (shared_skills / total_job_skills)
   - 80%+ overlap: 1.0
   - 60-79% overlap: 0.8
   - 40-59% overlap: 0.6
   - <40% overlap: 0.4

4. **Local Availability** (10% weight)
   - In-region program: 1.0
   - Online/hybrid: 0.9
   - Out-of-region: 0.7

**Scoring Formula:**
```typescript
relevanceScore = 
  (cipSocStrength * 0.4) +
  (levelMatch * 0.2) +
  (skillsOverlap * 0.3) +
  (localAvailability * 0.1)

// Normalize to 0-100
displayScore = Math.round(relevanceScore * 100)
```

#### Implementation Plan

**Step 1: Update Query Function (30 min)**
```typescript
// File: /src/lib/database/queries.ts
export async function getRelatedPrograms(
  jobId: string, 
  limit: number = 30
): Promise<ProgramWithRelevance[]> {
  
  // 1. Fetch job details to get skills and level
  const job = await getJobById(jobId)
  const jobSkills = job.skills?.map(s => s.skill_id) || []
  
  // 2. Fetch programs via program_jobs
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('program_jobs')
    .select(`
      programs!inner(
        *,
        school:schools!inner(*),
        program_skills(skill_id)
      )
    `)
    .eq('job_id', jobId)
    .limit(100) // Get more, then filter
  
  // 3. Calculate relevance for each program
  const programsWithScores = data?.map(pj => {
    const program = pj.programs
    const programSkills = program.program_skills?.map(ps => ps.skill_id) || []
    
    // Calculate skill overlap
    const sharedSkills = jobSkills.filter(js => programSkills.includes(js))
    const skillsOverlap = jobSkills.length > 0 
      ? sharedSkills.length / jobSkills.length 
      : 0
    
    // Calculate level match
    const levelMatch = calculateLevelMatch(job, program)
    
    // Calculate relevance score
    const relevanceScore = 
      (0.4 * 1.0) + // CIP-SOC (assume primary for now)
      (0.2 * levelMatch) +
      (0.3 * skillsOverlap) +
      (0.1 * 1.0) // Local (assume available)
    
    return {
      ...program,
      relevance_score: Math.round(relevanceScore * 100),
      shared_skills_count: sharedSkills.length
    }
  })
  
  // 4. Sort by relevance and limit
  return programsWithScores
    ?.sort((a, b) => b.relevance_score - a.relevance_score)
    .slice(0, limit) || []
}

function calculateLevelMatch(job: any, program: any): number {
  const programLevel = program.program_type?.toLowerCase() || ''
  const jobLevel = job.category?.toLowerCase() || ''
  
  // Simple matching logic
  if (programLevel.includes('certificate')) {
    return jobLevel.includes('entry') || jobLevel.includes('assistant') ? 1.0 : 0.7
  }
  if (programLevel.includes('bachelor')) {
    return jobLevel.includes('senior') || jobLevel.includes('manager') ? 1.0 : 0.8
  }
  if (programLevel.includes('master') || programLevel.includes('graduate')) {
    return jobLevel.includes('director') || jobLevel.includes('executive') ? 1.0 : 0.7
  }
  
  return 0.8 // Default
}
```

**Step 2: Update UI to Display Score (15 min)**
```typescript
// File: /src/app/(main)/jobs/[id]/page.tsx

// In the programs section, add match percentage badge:
<FeaturedProgramCard
  // ... existing props
  skillsCallout={{
    type: 'match',
    count: program.relevance_score,
    label: `${program.relevance_score}% Match`,
    href: undefined
  }}
/>
```

**Step 3: Add Visual Indicator (15 min)**
```typescript
// File: /src/components/ui/featured-program-card.tsx

// Add match badge at top of card:
{relevanceScore && relevanceScore >= 70 && (
  <Badge className="bg-green-100 text-green-800">
    {relevanceScore}% Match
  </Badge>
)}
```

#### Files to Update
- `/src/lib/database/queries.ts` - Update `getRelatedPrograms()`
- `/src/app/(main)/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` - Pass relevance score to cards
- `/src/components/ui/featured-program-card.tsx` - Display match badge (optional)

#### Estimated Effort
- Query logic: 30 minutes
- UI updates: 15 minutes
- Testing: 15 minutes
- **Total: 1 hour**

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Programs sorted by relevance score (highest first)
- [ ] Match percentage displayed on cards
- [ ] Top matches are genuinely more relevant
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable (<2s load)

---

### Phase 5: Assessment Results Integration (Future)

**Goal:** Replace mock program recommendations with real crosswalk data.

**Implementation:**
1. Query `program_skills` for programs teaching gap skills
2. Calculate relevance based on skill gap coverage
3. Display "This program addresses 5 of your 8 skill gaps"

**Estimated Effort:** 7-9 hours

**Priority:** High (post-launch)

---

### Phase 6: UI Simplification (Future)

**Goal:** Streamline program cards for better scannability.

**Changes:**
- Reduce visual complexity
- Emphasize key info (name, type, duration)
- Remove redundant elements

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Priority:** Medium (based on user feedback)
