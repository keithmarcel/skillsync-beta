---

## Feature 1: Multi-Role User Management System

**Branch:** `feature/multi-role-user-auth`

### User Types

**1. Basic User (Default)**
- General SkillSync user
- Access to: Browse jobs, take assessments, view programs, manage profile

### Database Schema Requirements

```sql
-- Update profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role VARCHAR DEFAULT 'user',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS school_id UUID REFERENCES schools(id),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS linkedin_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS avatar_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_mock_user BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS max_programs INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS max_featured_programs INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS max_featured_roles INTEGER;

-- Role enum: 'user', 'super_admin', 'provider_admin', 'employer_admin'

-- Invitations table (for Super Admin to invite Provider/Employer admins)
CREATE TABLE admin_invitations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR NOT NULL, -- 'provider_admin' or 'employer_admin'
  company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id),
  school_id UUID REFERENCES schools(id),
  invited_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  invited_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  accepted_at TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'pending', 'accepted', 'expired'
  token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```

### Implementation Requirements

**Super Admin Invitation Flow:**
1. New page: `/admin/invitations` or section in Users page
2. Form to invite Provider Admin or Employer Admin
3. Fields: Email, Role Type, Associated Company/School, Limits
4. Generates unique invitation token
5. Sends email with signup link
6. Link includes token for automatic role assignment

**Provider Admin Dashboard:**

## Feature 2: Employer Invitation System

**Branch:** `feature/employer-invitations`

### Overview

Allow employers to invite qualified candidates to apply for roles. Two possible flows to decide:

**Option A: User-Initiated Submission**
1. User completes assessment
2. If score meets threshold, "Submit to Employer" button appears
3. User submits assessment
4. Employer sees submission in dashboard
5. Employer sends invitation to apply
6. User receives invitation notification

**Option B: Employer-Initiated (Recommended)**
1. User completes assessment
2. If score meets proficiency threshold (e.g., 85%+), automatically visible to employer
3. Employer browses qualified candidates
4. Employer sends invitation to apply
5. User receives invitation notification

### Proficiency Threshold

**Question:** Single threshold or dual threshold?

**Option 1: Single Threshold (Simpler)**
- Employer sets one threshold (e.g., 85%)
- User sees "Role Ready" if >= 85%
- User shows in employer dashboard if >= 85%

**Option 2: Dual Threshold (More Nuanced)**
- Display threshold: 90% (user sees "Role Ready")
- Visibility threshold: 85% (employer can see candidate)
- Allows employers to see "close" candidates

**Recommendation Needed:** Which approach?

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Employer invitations to candidates
CREATE TABLE employer_invitations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  employer_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id), -- employer_admin user
  candidate_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id), -- basic user
  job_id UUID REFERENCES jobs(id), -- featured role
  assessment_id UUID REFERENCES assessments(id),
  application_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT,
  status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'pending', 'viewed', 'applied', 'declined', 'archived'
  sent_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  viewed_at TIMESTAMP,
  responded_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add proficiency threshold to jobs
ALTER TABLE jobs
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS proficiency_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 90;

-- Track user assessment submissions (if using Option A)
CREATE TABLE assessment_submissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  assessment_id UUID REFERENCES assessments(id),
  job_id UUID REFERENCES jobs(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending' -- 'pending', 'reviewed', 'invited'

## Questions for Clarification

### Employer Invitation Flow
**Decision Needed:** Option A (user submits) or Option B (auto-visible)?
- **Option A:** User must submit assessment to employer
- **Option B:** User automatically visible if meets threshold

**Recommendation:** Option B (simpler, better UX)

### Proficiency Threshold
**Decision Needed:** Single or dual threshold?
- **Single:** One threshold (e.g., 85%) for both display and visibility
- **Dual:** Display threshold (90%) and visibility threshold (85%)

**Recommendation:** Single threshold (simpler, less confusing)

### Notification System
**Decision Needed:** Email provider?
- **Option A:** Supabase (built-in, simpler)
- **Option B:** SendGrid (more features, more complex)

**Recommendation:** Start with Supabase, migrate to SendGrid if needed
