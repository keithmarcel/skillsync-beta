## üöÄ Quick Test Script

```bash
# 1. Seed test data (if not already done)
node scripts/seed-invitation-test-data.js

# 2. Update invitations to "sent" status
# (Run in Supabase SQL Editor: scripts/fix-test-invitations-status.sql)
# This makes test invitations visible to candidates

# 3. Test database
node scripts/test-invitations-db.js

# 4. View invitations
node scripts/view-invitations.js

# 5. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 6. Login as candidate
# Email: candidate1@test.com
# Password: TestPassword123!

# 7. Navigate to /invitations

## üìã Status Workflow Explanation

**Understanding `pending` vs `sent`:**

| Status | Visible To | Meaning | Trigger |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `pending` | Employer only | Candidate in pool, invitation NOT sent | Auto-populated when assessment >= threshold |
| `sent` | Candidate | Invitation sent and visible | Employer clicks "Send Invitation" |
| `applied` | Both | Candidate marked as applied | Candidate clicks "Mark as Applied" |
| `declined` | Both | Candidate declined | Candidate clicks "Decline" |
| `archived` | Neither (archived view) | Removed from active list | Either party archives |

**Why This Design:**
- Prevents spam - candidates only see intentional invitations
- Gives employers control over timing and messaging
- `pending` = employer's candidate pool
- `sent` = candidate's inbox

**For Testing:**
- Seeded data starts as `pending` (realistic)
- Run `scripts/fix-test-invitations-status.sql` to convert to `sent`
- This simulates employer clicking "Send Invitation"
