## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Invitations status:** All seeded invitations are "pending" (not "sent")
   - Need to update status to "sent" to show as unread
   - Run: Update invitations set status='sent' where status='pending'

2. **Company logos:** May not display if logo_url is null
   - Fallback to company name only

3. **Real-time updates:** 30-second polling only
   - Not true real-time (would need WebSockets)

4. **Role Details / Assessment Results:** Menu items not yet implemented
   - Placeholders in dropdown menu
