```sql
-- Add role and association columns
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role VARCHAR DEFAULT 'user',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS school_id UUID REFERENCES schools(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,

-- Add role constraint
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD CONSTRAINT valid_role CHECK (role IN ('user', 'super_admin', 'provider_admin', 'employer_admin'));

-- Add association constraints
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD CONSTRAINT provider_has_school CHECK (
  role != 'provider_admin' OR school_id IS NOT NULL
);

ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD CONSTRAINT employer_has_company CHECK (
  role != 'employer_admin' OR company_id IS NOT NULL
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_role ON profiles(role);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_company_id ON profiles(company_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_school_id ON profiles(school_id);
```

### Admin Invitations Table

## Testing Strategy

### Test Accounts Needed

1. **Super Admin:** keith-woods@bisk.com (existing)
2. **Provider Admin:** test-provider@example.com (create)
3. **Employer Admin:** test-employer@example.com (create)
4. **Basic User:** test-user@example.com (create)

### Test Scenarios

**Invitation Flow:**
1. Super admin invites provider admin
2. Provider admin receives email
3. Provider admin accepts invitation
4. Provider admin logs in to dashboard
5. Provider admin can only see their programs
6. Provider admin cannot access super admin tools

**Limit Enforcement:**
1. Provider admin at 299/300 programs
2. Add one more program (success)
3. Try to add another (blocked with error)
4. Super admin increases limit to 350
5. Provider admin can now add more

**RLS Security:**
1. Provider A cannot see Provider B's programs
2. Employer A cannot see Employer B's roles
3. Basic user cannot access admin endpoints
4. Super admin can see everything
