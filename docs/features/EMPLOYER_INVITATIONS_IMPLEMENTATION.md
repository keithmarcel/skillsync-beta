---

## Data Model

### Jobs Table Extensions
```sql
required_proficiency_pct (NUMERIC, default 90)
  - Threshold shown to users for "Role Ready" status
  
visibility_threshold_pct (NUMERIC, default 85)
  - Threshold for employer visibility
  - Candidates at or above appear in employer pool
  
application_url (TEXT, required for featured roles)
  - External URL to company ATS/application page
```

### Employer Invitations Table
```sql
employer_invitations:
  - id (UUID)
  - user_id (UUID) → candidate
  - company_id (UUID) → employer's company
  - job_id (UUID) → featured role
  - assessment_id (UUID) → qualifying assessment
  - proficiency_pct (NUMERIC) → candidate's score
  - application_url (TEXT) → copied from job
  - message (TEXT) → optional employer message
  - status (VARCHAR) → invitation state
  - is_read (BOOLEAN) → for notification badge
  - invited_at (TIMESTAMP) → when employer sent invite
  - viewed_at (TIMESTAMP) → when candidate clicked "View Application"
  - responded_at (TIMESTAMP) → when candidate took action
  - archived_at (TIMESTAMP)
  - archived_by (VARCHAR) → 'employer' or 'candidate'
  - created_at, updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

---

## Status Flow

### Employer View
- **`pending`** → "Invite to Apply" button (qualified, not invited)
- **`sent`** → "Invite Sent" badge (awaiting response)
- **`applied`** → "Candidate Applied" badge (user marked as applied)
- **`declined`** → "Declined" badge (user declined)
- **`hired`** → "Hired" badge (employer marked as hired)
- **`unqualified`** → "Unqualified" badge (employer marked)
- **`archived`** → "Archived" (moved to archived tab)

### Candidate View
- **`sent`** → "View Application" button (pending action)
- **`applied`** → "Applied" badge (marked as applied)
- **`declined`** → "Declined" badge (declined invitation)
- **`archived`** → "Archived" (moved to archived tab)

---

## Auto-Population Logic

**Trigger:** `trigger_auto_populate_employer_candidates`  
**Function:** `auto_populate_employer_candidates()`

**When:** After assessment completion (INSERT or UPDATE on `assessments.readiness_pct`)

**Logic:**
1. Check if assessment has `readiness_pct` and `job_id`
2. Verify job is a `featured_role` with `company_id`
3. Check if candidate score >= `visibility_threshold_pct` (default 85%)
4. Insert record with `status='pending'` (or update if higher score)
5. Candidate appears in employer's pool with "Invite to Apply" button

---

## Role Readiness Badges

### User View (Role Details Page)
- **90%+** → "Role Ready" badge (teal)
- **85-89%** → "Building Skills" badge (orange)
- **<85%** → "Needs Development" (not shown to employers)

### Top Performer Badge
- Shows when candidate scores **5%+ above** `required_proficiency_pct`
- Example: Role requires 90%, candidate scores 95%+ = Top Performer

---

## RLS Policies

### Candidates
- Can view their own invitations
- Can update their own invitations (mark applied/declined/archived)

### Employer Admins
- Can view invitations for their company only
- Can create invitations (send to candidates)
- Can update invitations (mark hired/unqualified/archived)
- Scoped by `profiles.company_id`

### Super Admins
- Full access to all invitations

---

## UI Components Needed

### Candidate Side (`/invitations`)
1. **Invitations Page** - Two tabs: Active, Archived
2. **Invitations Table** - Columns: Company, Role, Proficiency, Readiness, Status, Actions
3. **Notification Dropdown** - Header bell icon with badge
4. **Notification Items** - Recent 4-12 invitations, scrollable
5. **Actions Menu** - View Application, Mark as Applied, Mark as Declined, Role Details, Assessment Results, Archive

### Employer Side (`/employer/invitations`)
1. **Invitations Dashboard** - Two tabs: Active, Archived
2. **Candidates Table** - Columns: Name, Role, Proficiency, Readiness, Status, Actions
3. **Role Filter** - Dropdown to filter by specific role
4. **Actions Menu** - Invite to Apply, Mark as Hired, Mark as Unqualified, Archive Candidate
5. **Bulk Actions** - Multi-select with bulk operations

---

## Search & Filters

### Candidate View
- **Search:** Fuzzy search on company name and role title
- **Readiness Filter:** All, Ready, Building Skills
- **Status Filter:** All, Pending, Applied, Declined

### Employer View

## Migration Execution Order

1. Run `20251002141922_multi_role_auth_schema.sql` (adds enum values ONLY)
2. Run `20251002145900_update_existing_roles.sql` (updates existing role data)
3. Run `20251002145950_multi_role_schema_extensions.sql` (adds tables/constraints using new enum values)
4. Run `20251002145100_employer_invitations_system.sql` (creates employer invitation system)

**Critical Note:** PostgreSQL requires enum values to be committed before they can be used in constraints or checks. This is why we split the migrations:
- Migration 1: Adds enum values
- Migration 2: Updates existing data (requires commit after migration 1)
- Migration 3: Adds constraints that reference new enum values (requires commit after migration 2)
- Migration 4: Creates invitation system

*This implementation provides a complete, production-ready employer invitation system with automatic candidate discovery, role-based access control, and comprehensive status tracking.*
