## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Jobs table with SOC codes for all entries (featured roles + occupations)
- Unified job schema supporting both job types
- Strong database patterns (RPC functions, RLS, migrations)
- Admin tools specification includes skills management requirements
- Basic assessment table exists but lacks quiz infrastructure

### ‚ùå What's Missing
- **NO skills infrastructure** - No skills table, no job-skill mappings
- **NO quiz/assessment system** - No questions, scoring logic, or generation pipeline
- **API integrations are stubs** - Edge functions exist but not implemented
- **Skills relationships** - No connections between skills, jobs, and programs

### üìä Key Requirements
- **5-8 skills per SOC code** (no subcategories)
- **SOC codes for all jobs** (already implemented)
- **Skills as universal currency** for quizzes, recommendations, scoring
- **Real-time API data** from O*NET, BLS, Career One Stop
- **AI-powered quiz generation** based on required skills

### üéØ New Architectural Requirements (Post-Implementation)
- **SOC-Based Quiz Reusability** - One quiz serves multiple jobs with same SOC
- **Question Rotation System** - 40+ question pools, 15-20 per assessment
- **Cheat Prevention** - Usage tracking prevents question repetition
- **Typeform UX** - Single-question flow with progress indicators
- **No Right/Wrong Feedback** - Assessment feels like evaluation, not test
- **Comprehensive Analytics** - Engagement, completion, and progression tracking
