# SkillSync Skills Taxonomy & API Integration Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for establishing skills as the universal currency across SkillSync. Skills will power quiz generation, program recommendations, assessment scoring, and the entire user journey. The plan prioritizes skills taxonomy as the foundation, followed by quiz generation and API integrations.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **SOC-Based Quizzes**: Quizzes mapped to SOC codes for reusability across multiple jobs
- **Question Pools**: 40+ questions per skill with rotation (15-20 shown per assessment)
- **Cheat Prevention**: Question rotation and usage tracking
- **Typeform UX**: Single-question flow with progress indicators and no right/wrong feedback
- **Company Customizations**: Support for organization-specific quizzes while maintaining standards

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Jobs table with SOC codes for all entries (featured roles + occupations)
- Unified job schema supporting both job types
- Strong database patterns (RPC functions, RLS, migrations)
- Admin tools specification includes skills management requirements
- Basic assessment table exists but lacks quiz infrastructure

### ‚ùå What's Missing
- **NO skills infrastructure** - No skills table, no job-skill mappings
- **NO quiz/assessment system** - No questions, scoring logic, or generation pipeline
- **API integrations are stubs** - Edge functions exist but not implemented
- **Skills relationships** - No connections between skills, jobs, and programs

### üìä Key Requirements
- **5-8 skills per SOC code** (no subcategories)
- **SOC codes for all jobs** (already implemented)
- **Skills as universal currency** for quizzes, recommendations, scoring
- **Real-time API data** from O*NET, BLS, Career One Stop
- **AI-powered quiz generation** based on required skills

### üéØ New Architectural Requirements (Post-Implementation)
- **SOC-Based Quiz Reusability** - One quiz serves multiple jobs with same SOC
- **Question Rotation System** - 40+ question pools, 15-20 per assessment
- **Cheat Prevention** - Usage tracking prevents question repetition
- **Typeform UX** - Single-question flow with progress indicators
- **No Right/Wrong Feedback** - Assessment feels like evaluation, not test
- **Comprehensive Analytics** - Engagement, completion, and progression tracking

## Strategic Implementation Plan

Skills are the universal currency. Everything connects through skills:
- Jobs require skills ‚Üí Skills power quizzes ‚Üí Quizzes generate assessments ‚Üí Assessments drive recommendations ‚Üí Programs fill skill gaps

### Implementation Priority
1. **Skills Taxonomy** (Foundation) - Tables, relationships, basic data
2. **SOC-Based Quiz System** (Core Feature) - AI-powered assessment creation
3. **API Integration Services** (Data Pipeline) - O*NET, BLS, Career One Stop integration
4. **SOC Enrichment Pipeline** (Data Enrichment) - Automated SOC processing
5. **User Experience Completion** (Polish) - My Assessments, Dashboard, Admin Tools
