## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Goal:** Complete end-to-end assessment flow for Power Design demo showcasing:
1. **Employer Side:** Role creation → Quiz generation → Assignment
2. **Job Seeker Side:** Assessment taking → Role readiness scoring → Conditional results
3. **Automated Invites:** Threshold-based invite system for both sides

**Demo Flow:**
- Login as Power Design → Create 2 roles with AI-generated quizzes
- Switch to job seeker → Take assessment (low proficiency) → See programs to close gaps
- Retake assessment (high proficiency) → See upskilling options → Auto-invite sent
- Switch to Power Design → View invite queue → Invite candidate
- Switch to job seeker → Receive and respond to invite
