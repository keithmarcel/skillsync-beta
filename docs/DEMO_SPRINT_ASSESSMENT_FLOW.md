**Branch:** `feature/demo-sprint-assessment-flow`  
**Target:** Demo Tomorrow  
**Status:** Planning Complete → Ready for Implementation  
**Updated:** October 17, 2025 12:31 AM

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Goal:** Complete end-to-end assessment flow for Power Design demo showcasing:
1. **Employer Side:** Role creation → Quiz generation → Assignment
2. **Job Seeker Side:** Assessment taking → Role readiness scoring → Conditional results
3. **Automated Invites:** Threshold-based invite system for both sides

**Demo Flow:**
- Login as Power Design → Create 2 roles with AI-generated quizzes
- Switch to job seeker → Take assessment (low proficiency) → See programs to close gaps
- Retake assessment (high proficiency) → See upskilling options → Auto-invite sent
- Switch to Power Design → View invite queue → Invite candidate
- Switch to job seeker → Receive and respond to invite

```typescript
// In /api/assessments/analyze/route.ts after updating assessment
if (roleReadiness.overallProficiency >= job.visibility_threshold_pct) {
  await createAutoInvite({
    user_id: assessment.user_id,
    company_id: job.company_id,
    job_id: assessment.job_id,
    assessment_id: assessmentId,
    proficiency_pct: roleReadiness.overallProficiency,
    application_url: job.application_url,
    status: 'sent' // Auto-send for qualified candidates
