## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Run in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
# Or via CLI if configured

-- File: supabase/migrations/20251016000002_add_assessment_question_types.sql
-- Adds: question_type, good_answer_example, max_length, display_order
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'quiz_questions' 
AND column_name IN ('question_type', 'good_answer_example', 'max_length', 'display_order');

-- Should return 4 rows
```

### 2. Code Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build

# Or deploy via your CI/CD pipeline
# Vercel/Netlify will auto-deploy on push to main
```

### 3. Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. ‚úÖ

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Run tests against production
node scripts/test-assessment-complete.js

# Expected: 54/54 tests passed
```

## üîç Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
- [ ] Assessment creation rate
- [ ] Question creation rate
- [ ] Analytics page load time
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Error rates in logs

### Database Queries to Monitor
```sql
-- Most active assessments
SELECT q.title, COUNT(a.id) as assessment_count
FROM quizzes q
LEFT JOIN assessments a ON a.quiz_id = q.id
GROUP BY q.id, q.title
ORDER BY assessment_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Question type distribution
SELECT question_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM quiz_questions
GROUP BY question_type;

-- Average questions per assessment
SELECT AVG(question_count) as avg_questions
FROM (
  SELECT q.id, COUNT(qq.id) as question_count
  FROM quizzes q
  LEFT JOIN quiz_sections qs ON qs.quiz_id = q.id
  LEFT JOIN quiz_questions qq ON qq.section_id = qs.id
  GROUP BY q.id
) subquery;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Non-Blocking
- Minor TypeScript lints in admin page (admin can use employer components)
- Drag-and-drop visual only (functional implementation pending)
- AI generation button is placeholder (backend integration pending)

### None Critical
All core functionality is working and tested. ‚úÖ

## üÜò Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

### 1. Revert Code
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
git push
```

### 2. Revert Database (if needed)
```sql
-- Remove new columns
ALTER TABLE quiz_questions 
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS question_type,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS good_answer_example,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS max_length,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS display_order;

ALTER TABLE quiz_sections
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS display_order;
```

### 3. Clear Cache
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```
