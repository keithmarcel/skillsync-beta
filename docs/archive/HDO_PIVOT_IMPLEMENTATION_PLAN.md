**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All Phases Finished  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Completed:** October 21, 2025 2:25 PM  
**Owner:** Keith + Claude

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Transforming High-Demand Occupations from an assessment entry point into a discovery & intelligence hub that connects regional labor market data with live employer demand.

**Key Terminology:**
- **Jobs** = Overarching bucket (Occupations + Roles)
- **Occupations** = High-demand occupations (HDO) - general job outlines, BLS/O*NET data
- **Roles** = Featured Roles - company-sponsored, employer-paid positions
- **User Flow:** Occupations → Roles → Assessments → Role Readiness

## 🔍 Outstanding Investigations

### High Priority
1. **Crosswalk Performance Testing**
   - Test query performance with current data volume
   - Determine if materialized views needed
   - Evaluate caching strategy

2. **Skills Customization Strategy**
   - How do employers modify curated skills while maintaining crosswalk?
   - Threshold-based overlap (e.g., 70% match)?
   - Separate "base skills" vs "custom skills"?
   - Track "skill drift" and show partial matches?

### Medium Priority
3. **Featured Role Detail Page Design**
   - Finalize layout for related sections
   - Determine card content and styling
   - Empty state messaging

4. **Admin Override System Design**
   - UI for viewing inherited O*NET data
   - Edit/override workflow
   - Restore to defaults functionality
   - Diff view between custom and default

### Low Priority
5. **Video Modal Feasibility**
   - CareerOneStop iframe embedding allowed?
   - Alternative approaches?

6. **Occupations Editor Refactor**
   - Match Role Editor experience
   - Same tab structure and UX patterns
   - Deferred until after quiz generation fix

## 🔗 Related Systems

### Database Schema
- **jobs table** - Both occupations and featured roles (filtered by `job_kind`)
- **soc_skills table** - Curated SOC taxonomy skills
- **job_skills table** - Job-specific skills (falls back after soc_skills)
- **program_skills table** - Program skills
- **cip_soc_crosswalk table** - CIP to SOC mapping
- **program_jobs table** - Direct program-to-job junction

### Skills Inheritance
- Query checks `soc_skills` FIRST, then `job_skills`
- Featured Roles automatically inherit curated SOC skills
- Employers can add custom skills via `job_skills`
- Crosswalk maintained via SOC code matching

### Crosswalk Logic
**Option A:** Direct `program_jobs` junction (fastest)
**Option B:** CIP → SOC → programs path (most accurate)
**Option C:** Skills array intersection (most flexible)

**Current Implementation:** Combination of A and B

```
Employer clicks "Generate with AI"
  → Fetch O*NET skills for SOC code
  → Match database skill to O*NET skill
  → Fetch CareerOneStop occupation data
  → Merge with company context

## Phase 3H: Multi-Portal Authentication System ✅ **COMPLETE - January 20, 2025**

### Overview
Implemented a comprehensive multi-portal authentication system with separate sign-in experiences for job seekers, employers, and providers.

### Deliverables
- ✅ **Reusable Sign-In Component** (`SignInForm`)
  - Variant support: `jobseeker`, `employer`, `provider`
  - Portal validation after authentication
  - Full page reload for auth state propagation
  - Custom branding per portal

- ✅ **Portal Pages**
  - `/auth/signin` → Job Seekers → `/`
  - `/employer/auth/signin` → Employers → `/employer`
  - `/provider/auth/signin` → Providers → `/provider`

- ✅ **Portal Redirect Alert** (`PortalRedirectAlert`)
  - Dark-themed (#101929) with white text/icon
  - Shows when user signs in at wrong portal
  - Single-line, content-hugging design

- ✅ **Middleware Protection**
  - Server-side route protection
  - Portal-specific redirects for unauthenticated users
  - Authenticated users redirected from portal auth to dashboard
  - Optimized and cleaned (25% smaller)

- ✅ **Auth Layout Wrapper**
  - No navbar on any auth pages
  - Clean, focused sign-in experience
  - Portal-specific navbar on dashboards

- ✅ **Role-Based Logout**
  - Employer logout → `/employer/auth/signin`
  - Provider logout → `/provider/auth/signin`
  - Job seeker logout → `/auth/signin`

### Security Features
- Server-side portal validation
- Session refresh on every request
- Protected routes at middleware level
- Role-based access control
- Super admin can access all portals

### Files Modified (11 total)
**New Files:**
- `/src/components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx` - Reusable sign-in component
- `/src/components/auth/portal-redirect-alert.tsx` - Wrong portal alert
- `/src/app/(main)/employer/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Employer portal
- `/src/app/(main)/provider/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Provider portal

**Updated Files:**
- `/src/app/(main)/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Refactored to use SignInForm
- `/src/components/auth/auth-layout-wrapper.tsx` - Hide navbar on portal auth
- `/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Role-based logout
- `/src/middleware.ts` - Portal protection and redirects
- `/src/app/(main)/employer/page.tsx` - Logout redirect + Company type fix
- `/src/components/employer/settings/deactivate-account-dialog.tsx` - Portal redirect
- `/src/app/(main)/page.tsx` - Removed old redirect logic

### Technical Highlights
- **Full Page Reload**: Uses `window.location.href` instead of `router.push()` to ensure auth state propagation
- **Portal Validation**: Checks user role after sign-in and redirects to correct portal if mismatch
- **Type Safety**: Fixed Company interface mismatch in employer page
- **Code Quality**: Removed unused imports, optimized middleware logic

### Testing
- ✅ Job seeker sign-in flow
- ✅ Employer sign-in flow
- ✅ Provider sign-in flow
- ✅ Wrong portal detection and redirect
