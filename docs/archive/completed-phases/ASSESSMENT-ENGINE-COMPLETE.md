## üéØ **TECHNICAL PRECISION ACHIEVED**

### **Weighted Scoring Algorithm**
```typescript
// Multi-dimensional weighting system
interface AssessmentWeighting {
  questionImportance: number        // From Quiz Generation Engine
  skillImportance: number          // From Skills Weighting Display  
  marketDemand: number             // From Enhanced AI Context
  responseQuality: number          // AI-evaluated response quality
  contextualAccuracy: number       // Real-world application assessment
}
