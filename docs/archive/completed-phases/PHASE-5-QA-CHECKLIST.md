- [ ] Refresh page → data still present
- [ ] Edit data → changes save correctly
- [ ] Delete role → data removed from database

---

## **🔌 API INTEGRATION QA**

### **10. BLS API Integration**
- [ ] Run enrichment on occupation with SOC code (e.g., "13-1082")
- [ ] Check database: `bls_wage_data` table populated
- [ ] Verify Tampa MSA data (area_code: "45300")
- [ ] Wage data includes: median_wage, data_year, last_updated
- [ ] Cache TTL set correctly (90 days from now)
- [ ] Force refresh works (bypasses cache)

### **11. CareerOneStop API Integration**
- [ ] Run enrichment on occupation with SOC code
- [ ] Check database: `cos_programs_cache` table populated
- [ ] Programs include: program_name, provider_name, cost, duration
- [ ] Provider types mapped correctly (Community College, University, etc.)
- [ ] Program types categorized (Certificate, Associate, etc.)
- [ ] Cache TTL set correctly (60 days for programs, 120 for certs)
- [ ] Regional focus verified (Pinellas County area)

### **12. Enrichment Status Tracking**
- [ ] Check `occupation_enrichment_status` table
- [ ] Status progresses: pending → in_progress → completed
- [ ] Error messages logged for failed enrichments
- [ ] Timestamps updated correctly (bls_updated_at, cos_updated_at)

### **13. Error Handling & Edge Cases**
- [ ] Test with invalid SOC code → graceful error handling
- [ ] Test with API rate limiting → proper retry logic
- [ ] Test network connectivity issues → appropriate error messages
- [ ] Test with missing API credentials → clear error feedback
- [ ] Test batch processing with mixed success/failure → partial success handling

---

## **⚡ PERFORMANCE & CACHING QA**

### **14. Intelligent Caching Verification**
- [ ] First enrichment request → calls APIs (slower)
- [ ] Second enrichment request → uses cache (faster)
- [ ] Cache expiration works (force refresh bypasses cache)
- [ ] Cache cleanup function works (`clean_expired_occupation_cache()`)
- [ ] Multiple TTLs respected (90/60/120/180 days)

### **15. Performance Validation**
- [ ] Cached responses < 1 second
- [ ] API calls with proper rate limiting (no rate limit errors)
- [ ] Batch processing efficient (no memory leaks)
- [ ] Progress tracking doesn't block UI
- [ ] Multiple concurrent enrichments handled properly

### **16. Cache Integrity**
- [ ] Cache data matches API response structure
- [ ] Cache keys are unique and properly indexed
- [ ] Cache cleanup doesn't affect active data
- [ ] Cache status monitoring works (expired vs fresh)

### **19. Backward Compatibility**
- [ ] Existing occupations without enrichment still work
- [ ] Featured roles without company-specific data still functional
- [ ] Legacy admin workflows unchanged
- [ ] Existing user data preserved
