# Shared Role Editor Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented a shared role editor architecture that both admin and employer can use **without code duplication**.

## Solution Architecture

### ✅ Single Source of Truth
- Admin role editor (`/src/app/admin/roles/[id]/page.tsx`) is the master
- Accepts optional `context` and `companyId` props
- Employer pages are thin wrappers that import and reuse the admin editor

### ✅ Context-Based Behavior

**Admin Context (`context='admin'`):**
- Shows all fields including company selector
- Can create both featured roles and occupations
- Has feature toggle button (super admin only)
- Redirects to `/admin/roles`

**Employer Context (`context='employer'`):**
- Hides company field (auto-populated from profile)
- Locks job_kind to 'featured_role' (disabled field)
- No feature toggle button
- Redirects to `/employer?tab=roles`

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `/src/app/(main)/employer/roles/new/page.tsx` - New role wrapper
2. `/src/app/(main)/employer/roles/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Edit role wrapper

### Modified Files
1. `/src/app/admin/roles/[id]/page.tsx` - Enhanced with context support
   - Added `RoleDetailPageProps` interface with `context` and `companyId`
   - Auto-populates `company_id` from `companyId` prop for employers
   - Conditionally hides company field using spread operator
   - Disables job_kind field for employers
   - Context-aware redirects and back navigation
   - Hides feature toggle for employers

## Key Implementation Details

### Field Hiding Pattern
```tsx
// Hide company field for employers (auto-populated from profile)
...(context === 'employer' ? [] : [{
  key: 'company_id',
  label: 'Company',
  type: EntityFieldType.SELECT,
  // ... field config
}]),
```

### Auto-Population
```tsx
company_id: context === 'employer' 
  ? companyId || null 
  : (isCompanyAdmin ? profile?.company_id || null : null),
```

### Context-Aware Redirects
```tsx
const redirectPath = context === 'employer' 
  ? `/employer/roles/${savedRole.id}/edit`
  : `/admin/roles/${savedRole.id}`;
```

## Employer Workflow

1. **Employer clicks "Add New Role"** in `/employer?tab=roles`
2. **Routes to** `/employer/roles/new`
3. **Wrapper component** passes `context='employer'` and `companyId` to admin editor
4. **Admin editor**:
   - Hides company field
   - Auto-populates company_id
   - Locks job_kind to 'featured_role'
   - Shows all other fields (SOC, skills, descriptions, etc.)
5. **On save**, redirects to `/employer/roles/{id}/edit`
6. **On delete/cancel**, redirects to `/employer?tab=roles`

## Benefits

✅ **Zero code duplication** - Single editor, multiple contexts
✅ **Easy maintenance** - Update admin, employer gets changes automatically  
✅ **Type safety** - Shared types and interfaces
✅ **Clean separation** - Context prop determines behavior
✅ **Consistent UX** - Same editing experience, different access levels

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Employer can create new role
- [ ] Company field is hidden for employers
- [ ] Company_id is auto-populated correctly
- [ ] Job_kind is locked to 'featured_role'
- [ ] All tabs work (Basic Info, Descriptions, Skills, Assessments, Role Details, SEO)
- [ ] Save redirects to edit page
- [ ] Cancel/Back redirects to employer roles table
- [ ] Delete works and redirects properly
- [ ] Admin editor still works normally
- [ ] Feature toggle only shows for super admin in admin context

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete flow with an employer account
2. Verify all redirects work correctly
3. Test skills extraction and management
4. Test image upload functionality
5. Verify publish/unpublish workflow
6. Test with 10-role limit enforcement

## Notes

- Employers have max 10 featured roles (enforced in table component)
- Employers can only create featured roles (not occupations)
- Super admin can still access employer editor by viewing as employer
- All existing admin functionality preserved
