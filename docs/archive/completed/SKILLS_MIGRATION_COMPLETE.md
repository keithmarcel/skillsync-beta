# Skills Architecture Migration - COMPLETE ✅

## Migration Results

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Completed

### Stats
- **Featured Roles:** 8
- **Job-Specific Skills Migrated:** 310
- **Database Table:** `job_skills` created
- **RLS Policies:** Enabled and configured
- **Data Loss:** None

## What Changed

### Before
```
All roles with same SOC code → Shared skills in `skills` table
❌ Editing one role affected all roles
❌ No seniority-level differentiation
❌ Accidental overrides across system
```

### After
```
Featured Roles → Role-specific skills in `job_skills` table
High-Demand Occupations → SOC-based skills in `skills` table (unchanged)
✅ Each role has independent skills
✅ Seniority levels can differ
✅ No cross-contamination
```

## Architecture

### Featured Roles (job_kind = 'featured_role')
- Skills stored in `job_skills` junction table
- Fully customizable per role
- Can differentiate Assistant/Mid/Senior
- Changes only affect that specific role

### High-Demand Occupations (job_kind = 'occupation')
- Skills from `skills` table filtered by SOC code
- Read-only baseline
- Maintains government data integrity
- Updated when SOC data refreshes

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Full Functionality)
1. **Update Skill Management UI**
   - Admin role editor skills tab
   - Employer role editor skills tab
   - Use `getJobSkills()` query function

2. **Update Skill Extraction**
   - AI-generated skills → `job_skills` table
   - Manual selection → `job_skills` table
   - SOC extraction → `job_skills` table

3. **Update Assessment Generation**
   - Use role-specific skills for featured roles
   - Use SOC-based skills for occupations

### Future Enhancements
- Importance level UI (1-5 stars)
- "Copy from SOC" button
- Skill recommendations by seniority
- Bulk skill management
- Company-wide skill library

## Files Created

1. **Migration:**
   - `supabase/migrations/20251016000000_add_job_skills_junction.sql`

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check `docs/SKILLS_ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE.md` for detailed architecture
2. Review query functions in `src/lib/database/job-skills-queries.ts`
3. Test with Power Design roles (8 roles with 310 skills migrated)
