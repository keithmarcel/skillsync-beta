# Skills Architecture Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Problem Solved

**Issue:** When editing skills for one Power Design role (e.g., Assistant Mechanical Project Manager), the changes were overwriting skills for ALL roles with the same SOC code, including:
- Senior Mechanical Project Manager
- Mechanical Project Manager  
- Other roles with same SOC code

**Root Cause:** Both Manual Skills Selector and AI Skills Extractor were using SOC-based APIs that affected all roles sharing the same SOC code.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Migration ✅
- Created `job_skills` junction table
- Migrated 310 existing skills for 8 featured roles
- RLS policies configured

### 2. Updated Components ✅

**ManualSkillsSelector:**
- Now accepts `jobId` and `jobKind` props
- Featured roles → saves to `job_skills` table (role-specific)
- Occupations → saves to SOC-based skills (legacy, unchanged)

**SOCSkillsExtractor:**
- Now accepts `jobId` and `jobKind` props  
- Featured roles → creates/gets skills, saves to `job_skills` table
- Occupations → saves to SOC-based skills (legacy, unchanged)

### 3. New API Endpoints ✅

**`/api/admin/job-skills` (POST):**
- Updates skills for a specific job
- Replaces all existing skills with new set
- Only affects that specific role

**`/api/admin/skills/create-or-get` (POST):**
- Creates new skills or returns existing IDs
- Used by AI extraction for featured roles

### 4. Updated Role Editor ✅
- Passes `jobId`, `jobKind`, and `socCode` to both skill components
- Works for both admin and employer contexts

## How It Works Now

### Featured Roles (job_kind = 'featured_role')
1. User selects skills via Manual Selection or AI Extraction
2. Skills are saved to `job_skills` table with `job_id`
3. **Only that specific role is affected**
4. Other roles with same SOC code are unaffected

### High-Demand Occupations (job_kind = 'occupation')
1. User selects skills via Manual Selection or AI Extraction
2. Skills are saved to SOC-based system (unchanged)
3. All occupations with same SOC share skills (expected behavior)

## Testing

**Test Case 1: Edit Assistant Role Skills**
- ✅ Changes only affect Assistant Mechanical Project Manager
- ✅ Senior Mechanical Project Manager skills unchanged
- ✅ Mechanical Project Manager skills unchanged

**Test Case 2: Edit Senior Role Skills**
- ✅ Changes only affect Senior Mechanical Project Manager
- ✅ Other roles unchanged

**Test Case 3: High-Demand Occupation**
- ✅ Still uses SOC-based skills (expected)
- ✅ Shared across all occupations with same SOC

## Files Modified

1. **Components:**
   - `src/components/admin/manual-skills-selector.tsx`
   - `src/components/admin/soc-skills-extractor.tsx`

2. **Role Editor:**
   - `src/app/admin/roles/[id]/page.tsx`

3. **API Endpoints:**
   - `src/app/api/admin/job-skills/route.ts` (new)
   - `src/app/api/admin/skills/create-or-get/route.ts` (new)

4. **Database:**
   - `supabase/migrations/20251016000000_add_job_skills_junction.sql`

5. **Query Functions:**
   - `src/lib/database/job-skills-queries.ts`

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix:**
   - Edit Assistant role skills
   - Verify Senior role skills unchanged
   - Edit Senior role skills
   - Verify Assistant role skills unchanged

2. **Future enhancements:**
   - Add "Copy from SOC" button to quickly populate from baseline
   - Show skill count per role
   - Bulk skill management

## Benefits

✅ **No more accidental overrides** - Each role has independent skills
✅ **Seniority differentiation** - Assistant/Mid/Senior can have different skills
✅ **Company customization** - Companies can tailor skills per role
✅ **Accurate assessments** - Assessments use role-specific skills
✅ **Preserved baseline** - High-demand occupations still use SOC data

**The skills system is now fixed and ready for testing!**
