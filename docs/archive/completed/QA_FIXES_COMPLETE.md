# QA Fixes - Assessment Management

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Design System Compliance - Badges
**Issue:** Badges not following status vs designation pattern  
**Fix:**
- Status badges (Published/Draft): `rounded` with colored backgrounds
  - Published: `bg-green-50 text-green-700 border-green-200`
  - Draft: `bg-yellow-50 text-yellow-700 border-yellow-200`
- Designation badges (Importance/Difficulty): `rounded-full` pills
  - Importance levels: Color-coded by level (red/orange/yellow/blue/gray)
  - Difficulty levels: Color-coded by difficulty (purple/red/yellow/green)
- **No shadows** on any badges

### 2. Design System Compliance - Buttons
**Issue:** Wrong green hover state on filled buttons  
**Fix:**
- Primary buttons now use: `bg-[#0694A2] hover:bg-[#047481]`
- Matches existing pattern across the app
- Applied to:
  - Save Changes button in edit page
  - Create Assessment button
  - All filled action buttons

### 3. Emojis Removed
**Issue:** Star emojis (‚≠ê) used in importance level display  
**Fix:**
- Removed all emoji usage
- Importance levels now show as text labels only
- Badges provide visual distinction through color coding

### 4. Associated Skill Dropdown
**Issue:** Dropdown yielding no data  
**Fix:**
- Fixed Supabase query to properly join `job_skills` ‚Üí `skills`
- Changed from `.select('skill:skills(id, name)')` 
- To: `.select('skill_id, skills(id, name)')`
- Added null check for `jobId` before loading skills

### 5. Difficulty Badge Added
**Issue:** Importance was badged but difficulty was plain text  
**Fix:**
- Added Badge component for difficulty display
- Color-coded by level:
  - Expert: Purple (`bg-purple-50`)
  - Hard: Red (`bg-red-50`)
  - Medium: Yellow (`bg-yellow-50`)
  - Easy: Green (`bg-green-50`)
- Shows multiplier value: e.g., "Expert (2.0x)"

### 6. Status Toggle Logic
**Issue:** Status showing "Published" when it should start as "Draft"  
**Fix:**
- Status now correctly starts as "Draft"
- "Published" button is **disabled** until assessment has 5+ questions
- Shows helper text: "Add X more questions to publish this assessment"
- Button shows question count when disabled: "Published (0/5 questions)"
- Validation prevents publishing with <5 questions

### 7. Question Count Tracking
**Issue:** Parent component didn't know how many questions exist  
**Fix:**
- Added `onQuestionCountChange` callback prop to `QuestionsTab`
- Callback fires when questions are loaded
- Parent component tracks count for validation logic

### 8. Analytics Tab Error
**Issue:** 400 error - querying non-existent `completed_at` column  
**Fix:**
- Changed query from `completed_at` to `analyzed_at` (correct column name)
- Fixed TypeScript type issues with user relation
- Analytics tab now loads without errors

### 9. Skills Loading Architecture Fix
**Issue:** Direct database queries in React components violated established API patterns  
**Fix:**
- Replaced direct Supabase queries with established API endpoint `/api/admin/roles/[id]/skills`
- Aligns with same pattern used in admin role editor
- Follows API-first architecture established throughout codebase
- Maintains all existing functionality while improving maintainability
- Skills dropdown now uses proper abstraction layer
- Easier to test and maintain going forward

## üìã Files Modified

1. `/src/app/(main)/employer/assessments/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
   - Added question count state
   - Fixed button colors
   - Fixed badge styling
   - Added publish validation logic
   - Added question count callback

2. `/src/components/assessment/questions-tab.tsx`
   - Added `onQuestionCountChange` prop
   - Fixed skill loading query (now uses API endpoint instead of direct DB queries)
   - Added callback when questions load
   - Replaced direct Supabase queries with established API pattern

3. `/src/components/assessment/question-modal.tsx`
   - Removed star emojis from importance dropdown

4. `/src/components/assessment/question-card.tsx`
   - Removed star emojis from importance display
   - Added difficulty badge
   - Fixed badge styling (rounded-full for designations)
   - Color-coded both importance and difficulty

5. `/src/components/assessment/analytics-tab.tsx`
   - Fixed `completed_at` ‚Üí `analyzed_at`
   - Fixed TypeScript type issues

## üöß Still TODO

### AI Question Generation
**Status:** Not implemented  
**Requirement:** "Generate with AI" button should work  
**Approach:**
- Reuse/enhance existing skills extractor pipeline
- Create AI generation flow similar to admin tools
- Generate questions based on:
  - Role/job requirements
  - Associated skills
  - Difficulty distribution
  - Question type variety

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours
- Create AI generation API endpoint
- Implement question generation logic
- Add UI flow for generation options
- Test and validate generated questions

## ‚úÖ Ready for Re-Testing

All QA issues have been addressed including the architecture fix. The assessment management system now:
- Follows design system patterns
- Has proper validation (5 question minimum)
- Displays data correctly (skills dropdown works)
- Uses correct column names (analytics fixed)
- Uses established API patterns (no direct DB queries)
- Provides clear user feedback

**Next Steps:**
1. Manual QA testing of all flows
2. Implement AI question generation
3. Final end-to-end testing
