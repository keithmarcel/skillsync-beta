## 🧪 Assessment Simulator (Super Admin)

### Purpose
Test different assessment scenarios without taking full quiz

### 5 Pre-configured Scenarios

1. **Benchmark Performance** (90-100%)
   - All skills at 95%, 92%, 98%, 90%, 94%
   - Readiness: 95%
   - Status: Role Ready

2. **Proficient Performance** (80-89%)
   - Skills at 88%, 85%, 82%, 87%, 83%
   - Readiness: 85%
   - Status: Role Ready

3. **Building Proficiency** (60-79%)
   - Skills at 75%, 68%, 72%, 65%, 70%
   - Readiness: 70%
   - Status: Close to Ready

4. **Needs Development** (<60%)
   - Skills at 55%, 42%, 48%, 38%, 50%
   - Readiness: 45%
   - Status: Needs Development

5. **Mixed Performance** (Varied)
   - Skills at 90%, 75%, 55%, 85%, 60%
   - Readiness: 72%
   - Status: Close to Ready

### How It Works

```
User clicks scenario
    ↓
Creates assessment (no results yet)
    ↓
Creates mock quiz responses
    ↓
Triggers AI analysis API
    ↓
Redirects to /analyzing page
    ↓
User sees loading spinner
    ↓
Page polls database every 2s
    ↓
AI completes analysis
    ↓
Auto-redirects to /results
```

**This tests the complete flow including AI processing!**

## 🔄 Analyzing Page

### Features
- SkillSync logo with animated spinner
- "Identifying skills gaps..." with animated dots
- "Hang tight while we review your quiz answers..."
- Animated progress bar
- Polls database every 2 seconds
- Auto-redirects when `analyzed_at` and `readiness_pct` are set

### User Experience
1. User completes quiz
2. Redirected to `/assessments/[id]/analyzing`
3. Sees loading animation
4. AI processes in background
5. Automatically redirected to results when ready

---

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Add Simulator to Job Page

In `/src/app/(main)/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`:

```tsx
import { AssessmentSimulator } from '@/components/admin/AssessmentSimulator';
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth';

// In your component:
const { user } = useAuth();
const isSuperAdmin = user?.email === 'keith-woods@bisk.com';

// Add before or after job details:
{isSuperAdmin && (
  <div className="mt-8">
    <AssessmentSimulator 
      jobId={job.id} 
      userId={user.id} 
    />
  </div>
)}
```

### Step 2: Test Each Scenario

1. Navigate to any job page as super admin
2. See the purple "Assessment Simulator" card
3. Click any scenario button
4. Watch the flow:
   - Creates assessment
   - Redirects to analyzing page
   - Shows loading spinner
   - AI processes (or simulates processing)
   - Auto-redirects to results
5. Verify results page displays correctly

### Step 3: Verify Each Component

**RoleReadinessWidget:**
- [ ] Bars glow and pulse
- [ ] Percentage displays correctly
- [ ] Status badge matches readiness
- [ ] Summary text is appropriate

**SkillsGapChart:**
- [ ] Bars are color-coded correctly
- [ ] Legend displays
- [ ] Percentages match skill scores
- [ ] Animations work

**StrengthsAndGrowth:**
- [ ] Strengths show skills ≥80%
- [ ] Growth areas show skills <80%
- [ ] Descriptions are appropriate

**ProgramMatchesCTA:**
- [ ] Shows correct proficiency requirement
- [ ] Button links to program matches
- [ ] Message changes based on readiness

## 📊 Database Schema Used

### `assessments`
```sql
- id (uuid)
- user_id (uuid)
- job_id (uuid)
- method (text) - 'quiz' | 'resume'
- analyzed_at (timestamp) ← Set when AI completes
- readiness_pct (numeric) ← Overall score
- status_tag (text) ← 'role_ready' | 'close_gaps' | 'needs_development'
```

### `assessment_skill_results`
```sql
- assessment_id (uuid)
- skill_id (uuid)
- score_pct (numeric) ← Individual skill score
- band (skill_band) ← 'benchmark' | 'proficient' | 'building' | 'needs_development'
- correct_answers (int)
- total_questions (int)
```

### `quiz_responses`
```sql
- assessment_id (uuid)
- question_id (uuid)
- skill_id (uuid)
- is_correct (boolean)
```

---

## 🔧 Integration Points

### AI Analysis API Endpoint

**Expected:** `/api/assessments/analyze`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "assessmentId": "uuid"
}
```

**Process:**
1. Fetch quiz responses for assessment
2. Calculate skill scores
3. Determine readiness percentage
4. Set status tag
5. Create assessment_skill_results records
6. Update assessment with analyzed_at and readiness_pct

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "readiness_pct": 85,
  "status_tag": "role_ready"
}
```
