## 🏗️ Assessment Flow Architecture

### Complete Flow:
```
1. User Takes Quiz
   ↓
2. Submit Responses → POST /api/assessments/submit
   ↓
3. Create Assessment Record (no results yet)
   ↓
4. Redirect to /analyzing page
   ↓
5. Trigger AI Analysis → POST /api/assessments/analyze
   ↓
6. Assessment Engine Processes:
   - Calculate weighted scores per skill
   - AI evaluates response quality
   - Calculate overall proficiency
   - Determine role readiness
   - Identify skill gaps
   ↓
7. Save Results to Database:
   - assessment_skill_results table
   - Update assessments.readiness_pct
   - Update assessments.status_tag
   - Set assessments.analyzed_at
   ↓
8. Program Matching Runs:
   - Identify critical gaps
   - Match to programs via program_skills
   - Rank by relevance
   - Generate recommendations
   ↓
9. Analyzing Page Polls Database
   ↓
10. Auto-redirect to /results when complete
```

## 🔧 Weighted Scoring System

### Multi-Dimensional Weighting:
```typescript
Weighted Score = (
  (Raw Correctness × 0.6) +          // Base accuracy
  (AI Quality Score × 0.4)            // Response quality
) × Final Weight

Final Weight = 
  Skill Importance (1.0-5.0) ×
  Market Demand (1.0-3.0) ×
  Company Weight (1.0-5.0) ×
  Performance Correlation (0.75)
```

### Skill Status Thresholds:
- **Exceeds:** currentLevel >= requiredLevel + 10
- **Meets:** currentLevel >= requiredLevel
- **Developing:** currentLevel >= requiredLevel - 15
- **Gap:** currentLevel < requiredLevel - 15

### Role Readiness Levels:
- **Highly Qualified:** 90%+ overall, no critical gaps
- **Ready:** 75%+ overall, no critical gaps
- **Developing:** 60%+ overall
- **Not Ready:** <60% overall

---

## 🤖 AI Evaluation Criteria

### Four Dimensions (0-100% each):
1. **Technical Accuracy** - How technically correct?
2. **Practical Application** - Real-world understanding?
3. **Industry Relevance** - Relevant to SOC role?
4. **Completeness** - Thoroughness of knowledge?

### AI Prompt Enhancement:
- Reuses enhanced context from quiz generation
- Market intelligence (demand, salary, trends)
- Company context (industry, requirements)
- Regional adjustments (Tampa Bay)
- Difficulty level considerations

---

## 🎓 Program Matching Algorithm

### Matching Precision:
```typescript
Overall Match Score = 
  (Gap Coverage × 0.4) +              // % of gaps addressed
  (Skill Alignment × 0.4) +           // How well skills align
  (Difficulty Match × 0.2)            // Appropriate level

Minimum Match Threshold: 70%
Top Recommendations: 5 programs
```

### Gap Prioritization:
1. **Critical Gaps:**
   - currentLevel < 60%
   - importance >= 4.0
   - High market demand

2. **Important Gaps:**
   - currentLevel < requiredLevel
   - importance >= 3.0

3. **Helpful Gaps:**
   - currentLevel < 85%
   - Nice-to-have improvements

### Program Ranking Factors:
- Gap coverage percentage
- Skill alignment score
- Difficulty appropriateness
- Duration and format
- Cost considerations
- Start date availability

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables Used:

#### `assessments`
```sql
- id (uuid)
- user_id (uuid)
- job_id (uuid)
- method ('quiz' | 'resume')
- analyzed_at (timestamp) ← Set when AI completes
- readiness_pct (numeric) ← Overall score
- status_tag (text) ← 'role_ready' | 'close_gaps' | 'needs_development'
```

#### `assessment_skill_results`
```sql
- assessment_id (uuid)
- skill_id (uuid)
- score_pct (numeric) ← Individual skill score
- band (skill_band) ← 'benchmark' | 'proficient' | 'building' | 'needs_development'
- correct_answers (int)
- total_questions (int)
```

#### `quiz_responses`
```sql
- assessment_id (uuid)
- question_id (uuid)
- skill_id (uuid)
- selected (text) ← User's answer
- is_correct (boolean)
```

#### `program_skills` (from today's work)
```sql
- program_id (uuid)
- skill_id (uuid)
- weight (numeric)
```

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

### Task #2: Build AI Analysis API Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/assessments/analyze`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "assessmentId": "uuid"
}
```

**Process:**
1. Fetch quiz responses for assessment
2. Call `calculateWeightedScore()` from assessment-engine
3. Call `calculateRoleReadiness()` with skill scores
4. Save results to `assessment_skill_results` table
5. Update `assessments` table with readiness_pct, status_tag, analyzed_at

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "readiness_pct": 85,
  "status_tag": "role_ready",
  "skill_results": [...],
  "analyzed_at": "2025-09-30T23:33:00Z"
}
```

---

### Task #4: Build Program Matching Logic

**Function:** `matchProgramsToSkillGaps(assessmentId)`

**Process:**
1. Get assessment skill results
2. Identify gaps (score < required threshold)
3. Query programs via `program_skills` table
4. Calculate match scores for each program
5. Rank by overall match score
6. Return top 5-10 recommendations

**Integration Point:**
- Results page calls this function
- Displays programs in ProgramRecommendationCard components
- Shows which skills each program addresses
