# Employer & Job Seeker Invitations V2 - Complete Refactor

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Completed:** October 15, 2025  
**Branch:** `main`

---

## 📊 Overview

Complete refactor of both employer and job seeker invitation management systems using unified DataTable architecture, proper tab patterns, and consistent UI/UX across both perspectives.

---

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. **Unified DataTable Architecture**
- ✅ Migrated both employer and job seeker tables to shared `DataTable` component
- ✅ Created reusable table configuration files:
  - `/src/lib/employer-invites-table-config.tsx` - Employer perspective
  - `/src/lib/job-seeker-invites-table-config.tsx` - Job seeker perspective
- ✅ Consistent column rendering, sorting, filtering across both tables

### 2. **Tab Pattern Standardization**
- ✅ **Primary Tabs (StickyTabs)**: Used for main page navigation
  - Job Seeker: Active | Archived
  - Employer: Dashboard | Listed Roles | Invites | Settings
- ✅ **Secondary Tabs (shadcn Tabs)**: Used for sub-content within primary tabs
  - Employer Invites: Active | Archived (within Invites tab)
  - Job Seeker: No secondary tabs (uses StickyTabs directly)

### 3. **Loading States Optimization**
- ✅ Removed skeleton loading on tab switches
- ✅ Added descriptive loading text with diamond loader:
  - "Loading Active Invites" / "Loading Archived Invites"
  - "Loading Active Invitations" / "Loading Archived Invitations"
- ✅ Consistent `LoadingSpinner` component usage across both pages

### 4. **Search & Filter Improvements**
- ✅ Context-aware search placeholders:
  - Employer: "Search candidates by name, role, or status"
  - Job Seeker: "Search by company, role, or status"
- ✅ Fixed filter logic for Role Readiness (proficiency_pct column)
- ✅ Fixed status filter mapping:
  - "Position Filled" → `unqualified` status
  - "Pending" → both `sent` and `pending` statuses

### 5. **Proficiency & Readiness System**
- ✅ Combined proficiency + readiness badges:
  - **Ready | 92%** (green) - proficiency >= 90%
  - **Almost There | 88%** (orange) - proficiency 85-89%
  - **88%** (gray) - proficiency < 85%
- ✅ Renamed "Building Skills" → "Almost There" across entire codebase
- ✅ Created centralized proficiency helpers (`/src/lib/utils/proficiency-helpers.ts`)

### 6. **Archived Status Handling**
- ✅ Consistent archived status rendering across both tables
- ✅ Shows `status_before_archive` when available
- ✅ Falls back to "Archived" badge when no previous status

### 7. **Actions Menu Logic**
- ✅ **Job Seeker Actions** (status-dependent):
  - **Sent/Pending**: View Application, Mark as Applied, Mark as Declined, View Role Details, View Assessment, Archive
  - **Other Active**: View Role Details, View Assessment, Archive
  - **Archived**: Restore Invite, View Role Details, View Assessment
- ✅ **Employer Actions** (status-dependent):
  - **Pending**: Invite to Apply, View LinkedIn, Mark as Hired, Mark as Unqualified, Archive
  - **Sent/Applied/Declined**: View LinkedIn, Mark as Hired, Mark as Unqualified, Archive
  - **Archived**: Restore, View LinkedIn, View Assessment
- ✅ Changed "View Assessment Results" → "View Assessment"

### 8. **Error Handling & Debugging**
- ✅ Added comprehensive console logging for employer actions
- ✅ Added user-facing error alerts
- ✅ Created debug SQL script: `/scripts/check-keith-woods-invitation-status.sql`

## 🧪 Testing Completed

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Tab switching (no skeleton flash)
- ✅ Search functionality (context-aware placeholders)
- ✅ Filter functionality (Role Readiness, Status)
- ✅ Sort functionality (all sortable columns)
- ✅ Actions menu (status-dependent logic)
- ✅ Archived status display (shows original status)
- ✅ Loading states (descriptive text)
- ✅ Status updates (employer → job seeker sync verified)

### Database Verification
- ✅ Status updates persist correctly
- ✅ `status_before_archive` populated on archive
- ✅ RLS policies working correctly
- ✅ Employer actions scoped to company_id

---

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Row Level Security
- ✅ Job seekers can only see their own invitations
- ✅ Employers can only see candidates for their company
- ✅ Super admins have full access
- ✅ All updates scoped by user/company

### Action Authorization
- ✅ Employer actions check `company_id` match
- ✅ Job seeker actions check `user_id` match
- ✅ Archive/restore properly scoped

---

## 📊 Key Metrics

### Code Quality
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate code (2 table implementations → 1 shared DataTable)
- ✅ Consistent patterns across employer and job seeker views
- ✅ Reusable table configuration architecture
- ✅ Centralized proficiency logic

### Performance
- ✅ Reduced unnecessary re-renders on tab switches
- ✅ Efficient data fetching (no skeleton flash)
- ✅ Proper loading state management

### User Experience
- ✅ Consistent terminology ("Almost There" everywhere)
- ✅ Clear loading feedback
- ✅ Status-dependent actions (no invalid operations)
- ✅ Proper archived item handling

---

## 🎯 Technical Achievements

### 1. **Unified Table Architecture**
Created reusable table configuration pattern that can be extended to other entities (programs, assessments, etc.)

### 2. **Proficiency System**
Centralized proficiency calculations with single source of truth:
- `isReady()` - Meets required proficiency
- `isAlmostThere()` - Close to required proficiency
- `isTopPerformer()` - Exceeds required proficiency
- `getReadinessLabel()` - Returns display label
- `getProficiencyStatus()` - Comprehensive status object

### 3. **Tab Pattern Guidelines**
Established clear patterns for primary vs secondary navigation:
- **Primary (StickyTabs)**: Main page sections, URL-synced, sticky on scroll
- **Secondary (shadcn Tabs)**: Sub-content, not URL-synced, pill/button style

### 4. **Loading State Pattern**
Consistent loading experience:
- Initial page load: Full page loader with descriptive text
- Tab switches: Table-level loading (no skeleton flash)
- Action feedback: Inline loading states
