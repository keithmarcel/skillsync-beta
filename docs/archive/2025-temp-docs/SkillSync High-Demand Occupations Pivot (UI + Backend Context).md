# SkillSync High-DemandOccupations Pivot (UI + Backend Context)

**Status:** Phase 1 Complete  
**Branch:** `main` (Phase 1 merged)  
**Updated:** October 9, 2025

## Context

SkillSync's High-DemandOccupations (HDO) section has been successfully redefined. The HDO Tab and HDO Details Page are now discovery hubs that surface regional labor market data and connect with Featured Roles, completely disconnected from assessment flows. This pivot has been completed in phases.

**Key Terminology:**
- **Jobs** = Overarching bucket (includes bothOccupations and Roles)
- **Occupations** = High-demand occupations (HDO) - general job outlines, labor market data
- **Roles** = Featured Roles - company-sponsored, employer-paid positions
- **Flow:**Occupations → Roles → Assessments → Role Readiness

## Phase 1: Foundation & Data COMPLETE

### 1A: UI & Routing Updates (Disconnect HDO from Assessments)

**Completed:**
- Removed "Take Assessment" and "Upload resume" from HDO table actions
- Removed AVG Salary and Role Readiness columns
- Added "Related Jobs" column with badge showing open roles count
- Added "Education & Training" column with program matches count
- Both columns link to occupation details with smooth scroll
- Removed all assessment entry points from HDO details pages

### 1B: Featured Card Refinements

**Completed:**
- Standardized featured card component styling
- Implemented "Load More" functionality (shows first 6, then reveals more)
- Consistent responsive grid layouts
- Clean empty states with proper messaging

### 1C: BLS 2024 Regional Data Upgrade

**Completed:**
- Imported 105 wage records (35 occupations × 3 geographic areas)
- Regional priority: Tampa-St. Petersburg MSA → Florida State → National
- May 2024 OEWS data (2-year improvement over 2022)
- FixedSOC code format (.00 suffix) for proper database matching
- UI shows regional context with area names (e.g., "Tampa Bay Area")

### 1D: O*NET Data Pipeline & Coverage

**Completed:**
- O*NET API integration via CareerOneStop service
- Occupation enrichment service with AI supplementation
- Current coverage: 79% responsibilities, 66% tasks, 0% tools
- Enrichment script created and ready for full population
- Featured roles strategy: Wait for AI-assistedSOC refinement before inheritance

---

## Phase 2: Data Architecture & Admin Tools (NEXT)

### 2A: Schema & Data
-SOC code refinement with AI assistance for featured roles
- Skills inheritance strategy fromSOC codes
- Crosswalk logic forSOC matching and skill overlap queries

### 2B: Admin Tools
- O*NET data override system (companies customize inherited data)
-SOC code auto-suggest with AI validation
- Override tracking with restore defaults functionality

### 2C: Crosswalk Logic
- Performance-optimized queries for related roles/programs
- Caching strategies for real-time crosswalk data
- Threshold logic for "relevant" matches

---

## Technical Implementation

### Database State
- 105 BLS wage records (May 2024)
- 35 occupations with complete wage data
- All jobs have education_level and employment_outlook
- Regional priority working (Tampa → FL → US)

### Scripts Created
- `import-all-occupations-oews-data.js` - Regional wage import
- `enrich-jobs-with-onet-data.js` - Education/outlook enrichment
- `enrich-hdo-occupation-details.js` - O*NET data enrichment
- `check-onet-data-coverage.js` - Coverage analysis

### Services & APIs
- CareerOneStop API integration for O*NET data
- AI generation services for content supplementation
- Skills taxonomy mapper for cross-referencing
- Occupation enrichment orchestrATOR

## Key Outcomes Achieved

- **High-DemandOccupations are now discovery hubs** - No assessment entry points
- **Regional labor market data integrated** - May 2024 BLS data with Tampa priority
- **Crosswalk foundation established** -SOC matching and badge displays working
- **Featured Roles remain exclusive assessment entry points** - Clean separation maintained
- **Data pipeline ready for expansion** - O*NET enrichment and AI supplementation
- **UI polished with consistent interactions** - Icons, hover effects, smooth animations

---

## Success Metrics Met

- [x] Navigating to any HDO record → never launches an assessment
- [x] HDO tab shows Employer and Program counts based onSOC cross-references
- [x] Featured Role details → launch assessment → writes to assessment_results
- [x] Regional wage data displays correctly with Tampa Bay priority
- [x] O*NET data pipeline established and enrichment scripts ready
- [x] UI sections have consistent icons and hover interactions

---

## Legacy Data Preservation

- Original HDO-based skills extraction logic preserved for reference
- Assessment generation engine maintained for Featured Roles
- All existing data structures remain intact and queryable
- Clean architectural separation between static (HDO) and dynamic (Roles) content
