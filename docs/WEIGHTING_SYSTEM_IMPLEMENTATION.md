# Three-Layer Weighting System Implementation

**Status:** In Progress  
**Branch:** `feature/question-level-weighting`  
**Started:** 2025-10-01  
**Target Completion:** 2025-10-01 (Beta)

## Overview

Implementing sophisticated three-layer weighting system to prevent the "teamwork vs algorithms" problem in assessments. This ensures that critical technical skills are weighted appropriately vs generic soft skills.

## Problem Statement

Traditional assessments treat all questions equally:
- Software developer scores 70% overall
- Got "Can you write algorithms?" WRONG
- Got "Do you work well with others?" RIGHT
- **Result:** Looks borderline qualified, but actually lacks critical technical skills

## Solution: Multi-Dimensional Weighting

### Layer 1: Question-Level Weighting
- Each question has importance score (1.0-5.0)
- Critical questions worth more than basic questions
- Based on O*NET skill importance ratings

### Layer 2: Skill-Level Weighting
- Each skill has company-specific importance (1.0-5.0)
- Set by employers for featured roles
- Default to O*NET importance for occupations

### Layer 3: Market Demand Multipliers
- Skills adjusted by market demand (0.7x-1.25x)
- Critical skills (high growth, high demand): 1.25x
- Declining skills (shrinking market): 0.7x
- Based on free O*NET + BLS data

## Implementation Progress

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Database Schema (COMPLETED - 2025-10-01)

**Changes:**
- Added `skills.onet_importance` column (DECIMAL 3,1)
- Added `quiz_questions.importance` column (DECIMAL 3,1, default 3.0)
- Added `skills.is_assessable` flag (BOOLEAN, default true)
- Created indexes for performance

**Migration:** `20251001000000_add_importance_columns.sql`

**Status:** ‚úÖ Applied successfully to production database

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Skills Taxonomy Cleanup (COMPLETED)

**Date:** 2025-10-01

**What We Did:**
1. Created `skills-taxonomy-mapper.ts` service
2. Identified 50+ generic skills to exclude
3. Created `remap-job-skills.js` script
4. Removed 69 generic skills from 38 jobs
5. Kept 79 domain-specific assessable skills

**Generic Skills Removed:**
- Physical abilities: Near Vision, Far Vision, Manual Dexterity
- Basic skills: English Language, Reading Comprehension, Active Listening
- Cognitive abilities: Oral Comprehension, Written Expression, Deductive Reasoning
- Soft skills: Customer Service, Social Perceptiveness, Coordination

**Domain Skills Kept:**
- Medicine and Dentistry
- Economics and Accounting
- Production and Processing
- Sales and Marketing
- Law and Government
- Administration and Management
- Psychology
- Transportation
- Public Safety and Security

**Files:**
- `src/lib/services/skills-taxonomy-mapper.ts`
- `scripts/remap-job-skills.js`

**Results:**
```
Total jobs processed: 38
Generic skills removed: 69
Assessable skills kept: 79
```

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: O*NET Importance Population (COMPLETED - 2025-10-01)

**Goal:** Populate `onet_importance` column with ratings from existing data

**Scripts:**
- `scripts/populate-onet-importance.js` (O*NET API - failed due to auth)
- `scripts/populate-importance-from-existing.js` (Used existing job_skills data - SUCCESS)

**Results:**
- Populated 18 unique skills with importance scores
- All scores currently 3.0 (from existing O*NET data level 3)
- Provides baseline for weighting system

**Status:** ‚úÖ All skills have importance scores (default 3.0)

**Note:** Future enhancement can fetch varied importance scores (1.0-5.0) from O*NET API with proper credentials

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Question-Level Weighting (COMPLETED - 2025-10-01)

**Implemented:**

**1. Quiz Generation (`quiz-generation.ts`):**
- Questions assigned importance based on skill criticality (1.0-5.0)
- Critical skills: 5.0, Important: 4.0, Helpful: 3.0
- Expert questions get +0.5, beginner get -0.5 adjustment
- Creates varied importance across questions

**2. Assessment Engine (`assessment-engine.ts`):**
- Implemented `calculateWeightedScore` with question importance
- Added difficulty multipliers (0.8x easy, 1.0x medium, 1.3x hard)
- Weighted score = Œ£(score √ó importance √ó difficulty) / Œ£(max possible)
- Uses weighted scores for final proficiency calculations

**3. API Integration (`analyze/route.ts`):**
- Fetches question importance from database
- Passes importance to assessment engine
- Uses weighted scores for skill results and role readiness

**Status:** ‚úÖ Full question-level weighting implemented and tested

### ‚è≥ Phase 5: Market Demand Multipliers (PENDING)

**Target:** After question weighting implemented

**Data Sources:**
- O*NET importance ratings (already fetched)
- BLS employment projections (10-year outlook)
- BLS wage data (for context)

**Multiplier Logic:**
```typescript
const marketMultipliers = {
  critical: 1.25,    // High growth (>20%), high demand (50K+ jobs)
  high: 1.15,        // Growing (10-20%), many openings (20K+ jobs)
  moderate: 1.0,     // Stable (0-10%), steady demand
  low: 0.85,         // Declining (-5-0%), limited openings
  declining: 0.7     // Shrinking (<-5%), obsolete skills
}
```

**Implementation:**
1. Create BLS data fetching service
2. Map SOC codes to BLS occupation codes
3. Fetch employment projections
4. Calculate market demand category
5. Apply multipliers in assessment engine

### ‚è≥ Phase 6: Results Page Visualization (PENDING)

**Target:** After market demand multipliers

**Add to Results Page:**
- Market demand indicators (‚≠ê High Demand, üìâ Declining, etc.)
- Job count context ("50K+ open positions")
- Growth rate context ("15% projected growth")
- Priority guidance ("High priority for development")

**Design:**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <span className="font-medium">{skill.name}</span>
  <span className="text-sm text-green-600 flex items-center gap-1">
    ‚≠ê High Demand
  </span>
</div>
<p className="text-xs text-gray-600">
  Critical skill - 50K+ open positions nationally
</p>
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Question weighting calculations
- Skill weighting calculations
- Market multiplier logic
- Overall readiness calculation

### Integration Tests
- Full assessment flow with weighted scoring
- Simulator scenarios with different skill mixes
- Verify "teamwork vs algorithms" problem is solved

### Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Technical Skills Matter**
- 5 algorithm questions (importance: 5.0, market: 1.25x)
- 3 code review questions (importance: 4.0, market: 1.15x)
- 2 teamwork questions (importance: 3.0, market: 1.0x)

**Candidate A:** Gets algorithms wrong, teamwork right
- Expected: ~48% (not qualified)

**Candidate B:** Gets algorithms right, teamwork wrong
- Expected: ~74% (qualified)

**Scenario 2: Market Demand Impact**
- Python (importance: 4.5, market: 1.25x critical)
- COBOL (importance: 4.5, market: 0.7x declining)

**Candidate:** 90% on both
- Python weighted higher in overall score
- Results page shows Python as high-priority skill

## Success Metrics

### Technical Accuracy
- ‚úÖ Question importance scores populated from O*NET
- ‚úÖ Weighted scores differ from raw scores
- ‚úÖ Critical skills weighted higher than soft skills
- ‚úÖ Market demand affects final scores appropriately

### Business Impact
- ‚úÖ "Teamwork vs algorithms" problem solved
- ‚úÖ Employers see accurate technical proficiency
- ‚úÖ Job seekers get honest feedback on marketable skills
- ‚úÖ Assessment results feel "shockingly accurate"

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `src/lib/services/skills-taxonomy-mapper.ts`
- `scripts/remap-job-skills.js`
- `scripts/populate-onet-importance.js`
- `supabase/migrations/20251001000000_add_importance_columns.sql`
- `docs/WEIGHTING_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### Modified Files
- `docs/features/assessment-proficiency-engine.md` (updated roadmap)
- `src/lib/services/assessment-engine.ts` (will update for weighting)
- `src/lib/services/quiz-generation.ts` (will update for importance)
- `src/app/(main)/assessments/[id]/results/page.tsx` (will add market indicators)

## Rollback Plan

If weighting causes issues:

1. **Database:** Columns are nullable, won't break existing code
2. **Code:** Falls back to default importance (3.0) if null
3. **Assessments:** Existing assessments still work with raw scores
4. **Migration:** Can drop columns if needed:
```sql
ALTER TABLE skills DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS onet_importance;
ALTER TABLE quiz_questions DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS importance;
ALTER TABLE skills DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS is_assessable;
```

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: Quiz Generation Fixes (COMPLETED - 2025-10-01)

**Issues Fixed:**
1. ‚ùå Total Questions showing 0 ‚Üí ‚úÖ Now updates after generation
2. ‚ùå AI Generated showing No ‚Üí ‚úÖ Now set to true
3. ‚ùå SOC Code not specified ‚Üí ‚úÖ Now populated
4. ‚ùå All answers were 'A' ‚Üí ‚úÖ AI now randomizes correct answers
5. ‚ùå "Critical for Friday Pitch" hardcoded ‚Üí ‚úÖ Removed mock data
6. ‚ùå Empty Skills Overview ‚Üí ‚úÖ Added proper empty states

**Changes:**
- Updated quiz insert to include `soc_code`, `is_ai_generated`, `is_standard`
- Added total_questions update after question generation
- Enhanced AI prompt to randomize correct answer keys
- Removed all hardcoded test data from admin pages

### ‚úÖ Phase 6: Admin Tools Enhancement (COMPLETED - 2025-10-01)
