# Next Steps: CIP-SOC-Skills Pipeline Integration

## Current Status (Sept 30, 2025)

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Programs schema extended with 10 new fields
- [x] HubSpot programs imported (218 Bisk Amplified + 5 Direct)
- [x] Admin tools fully functional
- [x] Schools catalog affiliation implemented
- [x] Data integrity validated (35 tests passing)

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Phase: CIP-SOC-Skills Pipeline

## Overview

The CIP-SOC-Skills pipeline will create the **central fabric** connecting:
- **Programs** (via CIP codes) â†’ **Skills**
- **Jobs/Occupations** (via SOC codes) â†’ **Skills**
- **Assessments** â†’ **Skills**

This enables:
1. **Program-to-Job Matching** - Show relevant jobs for each program
2. **Skills Gap Analysis** - Identify missing skills between programs and jobs
3. **Personalized Learning Paths** - Recommend programs based on career goals
4. **Assessment Accuracy** - Generate targeted quizzes based on program/job skills

Populate skills for all programs based on their CIP codes using O*NET/Lightcast taxonomy.

### Tasks

#### 1.1 CIP-to-SOC Crosswalk
- [ ] Download NCES CIP-SOC crosswalk data
- [ ] Create `cip_soc_crosswalk` table
- [ ] Import crosswalk mappings
- [ ] Add indexes for performance

```sql
CREATE TABLE cip_soc_crosswalk (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  cip_code TEXT NOT NULL,
  soc_code TEXT NOT NULL,
  match_strength DECIMAL(3,2), -- 0.00 to 1.00
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(cip_code, soc_code)
);
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Quality
- **Risk:** CIP-SOC mappings may be incomplete
- **Mitigation:** Manual curation for unmapped CIPs, use program descriptions as fallback

### Performance
- **Risk:** Matching queries may be slow with large datasets
- **Mitigation:** Implement caching, pre-calculate popular matches, use database indexes

### User Experience
- **Risk:** Skills gap may be overwhelming
- **Mitigation:** Prioritize critical skills, show progress, provide clear next steps

### AI Accuracy
- **Risk:** Generated assessments may not be relevant
- **Mitigation:** Admin review required, user feedback loop, A/B testing

---

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Review CIP Crosswalk Data** - Download and analyze NCES data
2. **Design Database Schema** - Create crosswalk table migration
3. **Build Extraction Service** - CIP â†’ SOC â†’ Skills pipeline
4. **Create Admin UI** - Enrichment interface for programs
5. **Test with Sample Programs** - Validate approach with 10 programs
