- [ ] Extract skills via O*NET API
- [ ] Match to Lightcast taxonomy
- [ ] Verify all programs have skills

### 4. Run Database Migrations (5 min)
**In Supabase SQL Editor:**
- [ ] Run `20250930000006_add_program_jobs_junction.sql`
- [ ] Run `20250930000007_add_schools_published_status.sql`
- [ ] Verify tables created

### 5. Test & Validate (30 min)
- [ ] Check `/admin/skills` - See 34,796 skills
